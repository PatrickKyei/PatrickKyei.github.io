                        <p>You struggle to make money, feel 'unlucky' and depressed because of 2 things:</p>

                        <ol>

                        <li>You don't have a valuable skill</li>

                        <li>Even if you have a skill nobody knows you</li>

                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>And so opportunities miss you</p>
                        
                        <p>You need an audience.</p>
                        
                        <p>Right now, it’s on social media.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most people think of social media as a silly app on their phone, yet they spend the majority of their life on it.</p>
                        
                        <p>You’ve still yet to make the connection that it is a massive part of the economy, business, learning, and life in general.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our ancestors had small audiences for the role they played in their tribe.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the world advanced through the printing press, radio, and television, how we acquired an audience for our work has drastically changed.</p>
                        
                        <p>The point is this:</p>
                        
                        <p>You need a group of people who know what you do and how it helps them. That’s what the business you work for does. That’s the only way to become the CEO of your life.</p>
                        
                        <p>You don’t need to go knocking door to door. You don’t need to send thousands of cold emails. But you still need distribution for your work.</p>
                        
                        <p>Right now, you can post your writing on an app like X, Facebook, have a larger account repost your work, and gain hundreds of followers in a day.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most people think they can’t build an audience because they haven’t taken the time to learn the sovereign skills of writing and persuasion.</p>
                        
                        <p>They don’t think they can:</p>
                        
                        <li>Write an impactful post by emulating what works (we all start as copy cats, how else do you learn?)</li>
                        <li>Write a DM to a large account to offer a form of value (knowledge or money) to build rapport.</li>
                        <li>Persuade them to exchange that value for something you want (a repost on social media).</li>
                        <li>Or, write a thread about someone in hopes that they repost it because it adds to their social proof.</li>
                        <li>Get tens of thousands of people to see your post, many of them following you.</li>
                        <li>Continue the process until you have an audience begging to pay you.</li>
                        <li>Launch a product and attain your freedom.</li>

                        <p>As the world advanced through the printing press, radio, and television, how we acquired an audience for our work has drastically changed.</p>

<p>The purpose of life is to do meaningful work, when you want and where you want. This is all possible through a personal brand online business.</p>

<p>People on the internet today are willing to pay good money to be where you are at now. What they want from you is knowledge of how you got there. And all you’d need to do is share and monetise it.</p>

<p>The days of working a boring 9–5 job is over.</p>

<p>You can take advantage of this now, and not just for being a fancy internet user.</p>
