                        <p>I started out like everyone else.</p>

                        <p>
                            I had no idea what I was doing with skills like Facebook ads,
                            email marketing, web design, digital art, dropshipping, eCommerce,
                            SEO, and almost any other skill you could imagine. But from those
                            failures, I learned 3 things:
                        </p>

                        <h3>1) Writing is the foundation of all valuable communication.</h3>

                        <p>When I say “valuable” here, I mean monetizable.</p>

                        <p>
                            Once I learned to write, I took my freelance web design business
                            (of all things) to 6 figures.
                        </p>

                        <p>Knowing how to communicate your value is important.</p>

                        <p>
                            Think about it, if you don’t want to learn to code, the only other
                            option should be writing.
                        </p>

                        <p>The front end of the internet is media.</p>

                        <p>Writing is the foundation of media.</p>

                        <p><b>Tweets?</b> Writing.</p>

                        <p><b>Threads?</b> Writing.</p>

                        <p><b>Newsletters?</b> Writing.</p>

                        <p><b>Blog posts?</b> Writing.</p>

                        <p><b>YouTube videos?</b> Done best with written scripts.</p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Instagram reels and TikToks?</b> Like reading well-written
                            tweets.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Images on Instagram?</b> Usually designed from a well-written
                            quote or saying.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Captions on any platform?</b> Writing that results in the most
                            followers and conversions (the content itself doesn't do that.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Any other form of online marketing, advertising, or
                                entertainment?</b>
                            Starts with writing.
                        </p>

                        <p>The list goes on.</p>

                        <p>
                            There’s a reason myself, my clients, and my friends get more
                            engagement, followers, and sales than those that show off their
                            booties and six packs all day:

                        <p><b>High-impact digital writing.</b></p>

                        </p>

                        <h3>2) Employers, prospects, and potential customers are online.</h3>

                        <p>It should be pretty clear by now that the world (especially commerce and work) is going
                            digital.</p>

                        <p>Employers are tired of sifting through terrible resumes.</p>

                        <p>Instead, they are reaching out to those that are displaying their value with their "Public
                            Resume" (online writing).</p>

                        <p>In short, you write about what you love and opportunities find their way to you.</p>

                        <p>I’m simplifying here, of course, but it’s the reality of many that are growing their audience
                            with little experience with writing itself.</p>

                        <p><b>The internet is an interest attractor</b> (just think about the people you follow, could
                            you
                            write what they write? Go and look. I bet you can).</p>


                        <h3>3) The future belongs to the creative.</h3>

                        <p>When I say creative, I don’t mean a creative skill like design. A skill has its limits.</p>

                        <p>I’m talking about the opposite of labor, as others can be trained into labor.</p>

                        <p>Creativity happens at the intersection of your genuine interests and personality.</p>

                        <p>The way you solve problems based on your unique experiences is going to be different from the
                            next guy.</p>

                        <p>If you can cultivate your creative problem solving skills, you shouldn't have a problem in
                            the emerging digital economy.</p>

                        <p>If you are brand new to writing, take a look at the next Tweet you read.</p>

                        <p><b>What are they doing with their writing?</b></p>

                        <p>Solving problems through education, actionable advice, and unique perspectives.</p>

                        <p><b>How do you pursue your genuine interests full time?</b></p>

                        <p>By educating and inspiring others through writing online.</p>

                        <p><b>How do you grow into your authentic self?</b></p>

                        <p>Through self-awareness and understanding.</p>

                        <p><b>How do you develop self-awareness and understanding?</b></p>

                        <p>Journaling.</p>

                        <p>AKA writing.</p>

                        <p>In a public journal (the internet).</p>

                        <p>All. Roads. Lead. To. Writing.</p>
                        
                        <p>If I were to go back and change one thing, it would be to learn writing first.</p>

                        You struggle to make money, feel 'unlucky' and depressed because of 2 things:

                        1. You don't have a valuable skill
                        2. Even if you have a skill nobody knows you
                        
                        And so opportunities miss you
                        
                        You need an audience.
                        
                        Right now, it’s on social media.
                        
                        Most people think of social media as a silly app on their phone, yet they spend the majority of their life on it.
                        
                        You’ve still yet to make the connection that it is a massive part of the economy, business, learning, and life in general.
                        
                        Our ancestors had small audiences for the role they played in their tribe.
                        
                        As the world advanced through the printing press, radio, and television, how we acquired an audience for our work has drastically changed.
                        
                        The point is this:
                        
                        You need a group of people who know what you do and how it helps them. That’s what the business you work for does. That’s the only way to become the CEO of your life.
                        
                        You don’t need to go knocking door to door. You don’t need to send thousands of cold emails. But you still need distribution for your work.
                        
                        Right now, you can post your writing on an app like X, Facebook, have a larger account repost your work, and gain hundreds of followers in a day.
                        
                        Most people think they can’t build an audience because they haven’t taken the time to learn the sovereign skills of writing and persuasion.
                        
                        They don’t think they can:
                        
                        - Write an impactful post by emulating what works (we all start as copy cats, how else do you learn?)
                        - Write a DM to a large account to offer a form of value (knowledge or money) to build rapport.
                        - Persuade them to exchange that value for something you want (a repost on social media).
                        - Or, write a thread about someone in hopes that they repost it because it adds to their social proof
                        - Get tens of thousands of people to see your post, many of them following you.
                        - Continue the process until you have an audience begging to pay you.
                        - Launch a product and attain your freedom.
