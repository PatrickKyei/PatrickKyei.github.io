                            With the development of the internet, information has spread
                            beyond measure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This led to the development of a more advanced, global, and
                            accessible society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Societies consist of institutions, and communities with shared
                            beliefs, and cultural ideas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The most notable aspects are the school system, workforce, social
                            and business tribes, and religious establishments.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Social media has expanded and collapsed the lines between these.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Everything is becoming more holistic and interconnected like rain
                            to the ocean as the pattern of Universal division and unity hints
                            at.
                        </p>

                        <p>The public school system had many problems:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Convergent thinking</li>
                            <li>Compartmentalized learning</li>
                            <li>Conformity over authenticity</li>
                            <li>Memorization over process</li>
                            <li>Failure as something to avoid</li>
                            <li>Authorities as unquestionable</li>
                            <li>Long work over efficiency and true value</li>

                            <li>
                                Decade-old curriculums that only worry about training you into a
                                replaceable job
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The new school system in the creator society allows individuals
                            to:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Pursue their curiosity</li>
                            <li>Find teachers (creators) that they learn best from</li>
                            <li>
                                Treat learning as a part of life rather than an annoying
                                obligation
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Learn modern skills that allow you to adapt fast to the
                                fast-changing environment
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Find specific knowledge that contributes to their pursuit of
                                self-generated (rather than assigned) goals
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Prioritize entrepreneurship as it is the only logical end goal
                                for those that want more out of life
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The new school system is internet content. None of this is
                            labeled. It is just a part of virtual life.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The religious establishments narrowed the minds of its followers
                            and fought any perspective that contradicted their own.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, spiritual awareness and education are accessible in most
                            creator brands.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can open your mind, study different perspectives, and
                            self-experiment until you cultivate a philosophy that suits you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is not only for spiritual growth, but mental, financial, and
                            health-related.
                        </p>

                        <p>I've always had the dream of doing what I loved for a living.</p>

                        <p>Who hasn't?</p>

                        <p>
                            So I tried and failed at dropshipping, e-commerce, digital art,
                            photography, YouTube, agency work, and more.
                        </p>

                        <p>I finally saw some success with freelance web design.</p>

                        <p>Enough to quit my job and go all in.</p>

                        <p>1 year later, I realized that I built myself into a new 9 to 5.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I quit my job because I loved building <em>my own</em> projects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I thought freelancing was the answer, but I was spending countless
                            hours <strong>still</strong> doing work for other people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So I tried coaching (and made a decent amount of money) but was
                            met with the same story.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>I became a creative because I wanted to focus on my
                                CRAFT.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I wanted to do my own thing, not someone else's, so why did I keep
                            falling into that trap?
                        </p>

                        <p>This is when I made a crucial realization:</p>

                        <p>I had to earn with my mind, not my time, as Naval would say.</p>

                        <p>This realization led me to social media.</p>

                        <p>
                            If I wanted full control over my time and income, I had to focus
                            on building a digital product.
                        </p>

                        <p>Why a digital product?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Low-marginal cost of replication</strong> – You can
                                    build the product once and sell it forever without investing
                                    in more inventory or property.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Can be scaled as one person</strong> – All you need
                                    to do is focus on building an audience (the fun stuff) to
                                    fuel the digital product.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>You remove the cap on your earning potential</strong>
                                    – The amount of money you make is determined by (1) how good
                                    your product is and (2) how much relevant traffic you send
                                    to it with an audience, paid ads, or other beginner methods
                                    you learn in the course.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>


                        <p>
                            Building a digital product is what allowed me to take my
                            one-person business to $5 million+ in revenue working four hours
                            a day (because I don't need to spend time delivering the
                            product).</p>
                            
                            <p>It gave me the cash flow to invest in my new company
                            without VC
                            or investors. </p>
                            
                            <p>Freelancers and coaches will scream, "That's not
                            possible!"
                            because they still have the employee mindset. </p>

                        <p>They don't understand that <strong>once you have a digital product the amount of money you
                                make is determined by how much traffic you send to the

                                <p>If I have a digital product that requires
                            close-to-zero time from me, what's stopping me from creating content all day to
                            build an audience to fuel that product?</p>
                            
                            <p>I had a few more profound

                            Most smart individuals can replace their income, pay their
                            bills, or just have extra spending money. Let's say your goal is
                            $54K/year (an average salary). That's $4,500 per
                            month. Or $150 per day. That means you have
                            to sell: 1 product a day at $150 Or 3
                            products a day at $50 Or 10 products a day at $15. What can you sell at those price points?
                            Almost anything
                            in your head. For creators, it's obvious that this should be the
                            first
                            step. To generate cash flow to replace their income and go all in

                            business. For established businesses, it's a viable option to add

                        <p>3) Turn Yourself Into The Business</p>

                        <p>
                            If you've solved a problem in your life, you're qualified to
                            start a business. Not just any business, an education business
                            with minimal
                            startup costs. Once you have cash to invest in your dreams of owning a huge
                            company, you can, or you can sail off into the sunset and enjoy
                            the free time you have. How do you do it? First, understand why people buy a product. They
                            want to see a transformation. They want to see a
                            slight or drastic improvement in one area of
                            their life. They want to
                            <em>increase their market value through skill acquisition,
                                productivity, and self-improvement.</em>They want to
                            make more money, free up time, and increase their quality of
                            life. So, we start with the eternal
                            markets. Health, wealth, relationships, and
                            happiness. If you have experience in any of those
                            domains, you're good to
                            go. That is how we position any product we sell. Now, follow these steps:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Turn yourself into your customer avatar</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>List out your interests</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>List out your goals</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>List out your problems</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    List out the exact steps to overcome the problem and achieve
                                    the goal
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The problem and goal = the transformation for your
                            marketing. The steps to reach the goal is your system for getting
                            results. Slap a compelling name on the system and it's unique to
                            you. Now, turn it into a course, coaching, cohort, workshop,
                            template, checklist, system, tutorial, program, tracker, or
                            anything else you’ve seen other brands or creators sell.

                        <p>4) Build For Yourself, Sell To Yourself</p>

                        <p>
                            Most businesses fail because they try to solve a problem they
                            haven't experienced. <em>"But Dan, I still don't know what to
                                sell!"</em> Look at almost any successful
                            entrepreneur. What do they do? They solve a
                            problem in their life and sell the solution. From bars of
                            home-formulated soap that helps with eczema to a
                            habit tracking Notion template or self-taught meditation
                            practice. Some general rules of thumb to follow:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Build a product you've used before, but better.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Build a product you want but doesn't exist.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Build a product that solves a problem in your life.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            You are the most profitable niche. When you build a
                            product that you would use...And sell it under your own
                            name...To people that have a similar personality, interests, and
                            goals...You eliminate most competition.
