                            With the development of the internet, information has spread
                            beyond measure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This led to the development of a more advanced, global, and
                            accessible society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Societies consist of institutions, and communities with shared
                            beliefs, and cultural ideas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The most notable aspects are the school system, workforce, social
                            and business tribes, and religious establishments.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Social media has expanded and collapsed the lines between these.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Everything is becoming more holistic and interconnected like rain
                            to the ocean as the pattern of Universal division and unity hints
                            at.
                        </p>

                        <p>The public school system had many problems:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Convergent thinking</li>
                            <li>Compartmentalized learning</li>
                            <li>Conformity over authenticity</li>
                            <li>Memorization over process</li>
                            <li>Failure as something to avoid</li>
                            <li>Authorities as unquestionable</li>
                            <li>Long work over efficiency and true value</li>
                            <li>Intelligence defined by book smarts</li>
                            <li>
                                Decade-old curriculums that only worry about training you into a
                                replaceable job
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The new school system in the creator society allows individuals
                            to:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Pursue their curiosity</li>
                            <li>Find teachers (creators) that they learn best from</li>
                            <li>
                                Treat learning as a part of life rather than an annoying
                                obligation
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Learn modern skills that allow you to adapt fast to the
                                fast-changing environment
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Find specific knowledge that contributes to their pursuit of
                                self-generated (rather than assigned) goals
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Prioritize entrepreneurship as it is the only logical end goal
                                for those that want more out of life
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The new school system is internet content. None of this is
                            labeled. It is just a part of virtual life.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The religious establishments narrowed the minds of its followers
                            and fought any perspective that contradicted their own.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, spiritual awareness and education are accessible in most
                            creator brands.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can open your mind, study different perspectives, and
                            self-experiment until you cultivate a philosophy that suits you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is not only for spiritual growth, but mental, financial, and
                            health-related.
                        </p>

                        <p>I've always had the dream of doing what I loved for a living.</p>

                        <p>Who hasn't?</p>

                        <p>
                            So I tried and failed at dropshipping, e-commerce, graphics design, YouTube, agency work, and more.
                        </p>

                        <p>I finally saw some success with freelance graphics design.</p>

                        <p>Enough to quit my job and go all in.</p>

                        <p>
                            1 year later, I realized that I built myself into a new 9 to 5.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I quit my job because I loved building <em>my own</em> projects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I thought freelancing was the answer, but I was spending countless
                            hours <strong>still</strong> doing work for other people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So I tried coaching (and made a decent amount of money) but was
                            met with the same story.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>I became a creative because I wanted to focus on my
                                CRAFT.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I wanted to do my own thing, not someone else's, so why did I keep
                            falling into that trap?
                        </p>

                        <p>This is when I made a crucial realization:</p>

                        <p>I had to earn with my mind, not my time, as Naval would say.</p>

                        <p>This realization led me to social media.</p>

                        <p>
                            If I wanted full control over my time and income, I had to focus
                            on building a digital product.
                        </p>

                        <p>Why a digital product?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Low-marginal cost of replication</strong> – You can
                                    build the product once and sell it forever without investing
                                    in more inventory or property.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Can be scaled as one person</strong> – All you need to
                                    do is focus on building an audience (the fun stuff) to fuel
                                    the digital product.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>You remove the cap on your earning potential</strong>
                                    – The amount of money you make is determined by (1) how good
                                    your product is and (2) how much relevant traffic you send to
                                    it with an audience, paid ads, or other beginner methods you
                                    learn in the course.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Building a digital product is what allows you to take your
                            one-person business to $5 million+ in revenue working four hours a
                            day (because you don't need to spend time delivering the product).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It gives you the cash flow to invest in any new company without VC or
                            investors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Freelancers and coaches will scream, "That's not possible!"
                            because they still have the employee mindset.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            They don't understand that
                            <strong>once you have a digital product the amount of money you make is
                                determined by how much traffic you send to the product.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If I have a digital product that requires close-to-zero time from
                            me, what's stopping me from creating content all day to build an
                            audience to fuel that product?
                        </p>

                        <p>I had a few more profound realizations as my journey went on:</p>

                        <h3>1) Micro Education Businesses Are The Future Of Schooling</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm convinced that the future of schooling will be done on the
                            internet.
                        </p>

                        <p>With creators as teachers…</p>

                        <p>
                            And each student can learn from those who align with their
                            interests, worldview, and skill level until their needs inevitably
                            change.
                        </p>

                        <p>Can you not see this happening already?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                People have
                                <strong>lost trust in the traditional school system</strong>
                                to secure their future
                            </li>

                                knowledge and skills
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The creators are
                                <strong>attracting people with similar personalities</strong>
                                for an optimal learning experience
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>AI and automation are threatening labor jobs</strong>
                                and enabling online businesses to do more with less employees

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            People are realizing that the only way to secure their future is
                            to acquire valuable skills, knowledge, and interests that they can
                            pass down to others online.

                            Most smart individuals can replace their income, pay their bills,
                            or just have extra spending money. </p>

                        <p>Let's say your goal is
                            $54K/year (an average salary).</p>

                        <p>That's $4,500 per month.</p>

                        <p>Or $150 per day.</p>

                        <p>That means you have to sell:</p>

                        <p>1 product a day at $150</p>

                        <p>Or 3
                            products a day at $50</p>

                        <p>Or 10 products a day at $15.</p>

                        <p>What can you
                            sell at those price points?</p>

                        <p>Almost anything in your head.</p>

                        <p>For
                            creators, it's obvious that this should be the first step.</p>

                        <p>To
                            generate cash flow to replace their income and go all in on
                            business.</p>

                        <p>For established businesses, it's a viable option to add
                            a new revenue stream at 95%+ profit margins.

                        <h3>3) Turn Yourself Into The Business</h3>

                        <p>
                            If you've solved a problem in your life, you're qualified to start
                            a business.</p>

                        <p>Not just any business, an education business with
                            minimal startup costs.</p>

                        <p>Once you have cash to invest in your dreams
                            of owning a huge company, you can, or you can sail off into the
                            sunset and enjoy the free time you have.</p>

                        <p>How do you do it?</p>

                        <p>First,
                            understand why people buy a product.</p>

                        <p><b>They want to see a
                                transformation.</b></p>

                        <p>They want to see a slight or drastic improvement
                            in one area of their life. They want to
                            <em>increase their market value through skill acquisition,
                                productivity, and self-improvement.</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>They want to <b>make more money, free up time, and
                                increase their
                                quality of life.</b></p>

                        <p>So, we start with the eternal markets.</p>

                        <p><b>Health,
                                wealth, relationships, and happiness.</b></p>

                        <p>If you have experience in
                            any of those domains, you're good to go.</p>

                        <p>That is how we position
                            any product we sell.</p>

                        <p>Now, follow these steps:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    List out the exact steps to overcome the problem and achieve
                                    the goal
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The problem and goal = the transformation for your marketing.</p> 
                            
                            <p>The
                            steps to reach the goal is your system for getting results.</p>

                            compelling name on the system and it's unique to you.</p> 
                            
                            <p>Now, turn it
                            into a course, coaching, cohort, workshop, template, checklist,
                            system, tutorial, program, tracker, or anything else you’ve seen
                            other brands or creators sell.</p>
