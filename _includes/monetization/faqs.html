        <h4 class="has-text-white">Do I Need Any Prior Experience?</h4>

        <p>In digital marketing and product development? No.</p>

        <p>
          In your personal and professional life so you actually have knowledge
          you can put into a product? Yes.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will need some form of interest, skill, or expertise you want to
          turn into a business.
        </p>

        <h4 class="has-text-white">Is This A Self-Paced Course?</h4>

        <p>No.</p>

        <p>This is a cohort based program.</p>

        <p>
          There are both text and complementary video materials.
        </p>

        <p>I teach the theory in text so you can take plenty of notes.</p>

        <p>We go over each week module on a Live Walkthrough on Saturdays.</p>

        <p>You get acess to all recorded sessions for replay.</p>

        <p>You get access to all live sessions. </p>

<h4 class="has-text-white">Is There A Refund?</h4>

        <p>
          If you are reading this, I am assuming you follow me on social media.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn’t an ad where you have zero trust built before buying a
          product.
        </p>

        <p>With that, there are no refunds on this product. No exceptions.</p>

        <p>Why?</p>

        <p>
          <b>1) Personal responsibility is a value of mine.</b> Don’t make a
          purchase and back out because you don’t want to put in the work.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2) It’s a digital product.</b> There isn’t a way to return the
          product. Meaning there has to be a consequence for those that are
          trying to freeload.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have full confidence that the material in this course is accurate to
          what is promised on this page.
        </p>

        <p>Think twice before you buy if you are acting on impulse.</p>
