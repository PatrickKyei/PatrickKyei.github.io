The thing is, we’re not in the industrial age anymore, we’re in the information age.  
  
Getting a job and investing your savings isn’t the only option.  
  
In fact, if you couldn’t tell, people are losing trust in the conventional path’s promises to secure their future. It’s one of the worst options because your time, energy, and emotional well-being are at the control of a boss.  
  
All new wealth is being generated in the digital space.  
  
The idea space.  
  
The creator economy.  
  
A place where people aren’t limited by their connections or physical location because they can reach anyone with an internet connection.  
  
And if you have the right skills – writing, marketing, and building – all you have to do is get what you build in front of a micro-fraction of people that perceive what you built as valuable.

  
When I was getting into my career, I took plenty of notes during my learning phase.

Probably just like you did in your college years.

Little did I know that sharing those notes, would be incredibly profitable.

Today I unlock Facebook monetization on my account. That isn’t even the big game.

But let’s say for now I can earn from just sharing my ideas on the internet.

So, when I say, "You're probably wasting your knowledge."

I mean it.

You've spent years of your life acquiring experiences:

School. Work. Life.

Here’s the part they didn’t teach you in school and don't want you to figure out in your job:

You can sell your ideas **many** times over.

You can sell it while you sleep.

You spent time, money and energy to gain that knowledge, and therefore it’s worth something to someone.

Stop leaving money and opportunity on the table.

Sharing your knowledge publicly and turning it into products will boost your career, grow your network, and create authority.

There are zero downsides to productizing your knowledge.

## Why Your Knowledge is Worth Money

The average student leaves a UK university with **£48,470** of debt (according to The Telegraph) and in the USA it’s **$28,950** (according to Forbes).

That is the cost implication of that learning.

Also, your salary is proof that what you know is worth something.

Otherwise, you wouldn't get paid.

But there’s more to it than that.

_You are unique._

The problems you have solved may not be unique but they are unique to you and you have a unique experience.

That’s the Value.

There are people out there who are trying to solve problems that you have already solved.

Some will pay you to solve it for them.

Some will pay you to teach them how they can solve it faster for themselves.

It really is as simple as that.

Here’s a 4 step process to help you start:

## 1. Understand your knowledge

What do you know best? Think about you:

- **Professional experience:** What specific skills or knowledge have you acquired in your job?
- **Hobbies and passions:** What are you passionate about?
- **Life experiences:** What challenges have you overcome or lessons have you learned?

Make a list of all the big things you know and try to categorize them.

Think about how many people might be interested in these topics and how much they might pay to learn about them.

Once you've identified your areas of knowledge, consider how you can package that knowledge into something valuable to others.

Could you create tutorials, guides, courses, eBooks, or coaching?

## 2. Overcome your obstacles

Making time and having the motivation to create content can be challenging for some.

Content is how others will know about you can help them solve their problem so that they can pay you for that Value.

Here are some tips:

- Dedicate specific time blocks for content creation. Even small chunks of time can add up.
- Start small and build confidence gradually. Remember, everyone starts somewhere.
- Define your target audience and what they need to know. This will help you focus your content.
- Believe in your expertise. Your knowledge is valuable, and people want to learn from you.

It's one thing to be motivated. It's something else to have systems in place that actually work.

James Clear says:

> “_**You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.”**_

This means that it doesn’t really matter what your goal is, you need to work on the systems that support them.

For example: if you want to get up early, put your alarm on the other side of the room.

That’s a _**system**_ that will make you get out of bed.

You will achieve that _**goal**_.

You need to do the same when making content.

## 3. Share your knowledge

Don’t overthink this part.

Every piece of content is a ‘product’.

Some of these products are free and some of them are paid.

And it all starts with serving an audience.

This takes time, consistency, and effort.

Here are some strategies:

- **Social media**: Use platforms like X, Facebook, Threads, LinkedIn (_these are the easiest to start with because you don't need technical knowledge like video editing or graphic design_) to share your content and connect with potential customers.
- **Email marketing:** Build an email list and send regular updates to your subscribers.
- **Content promotion:** Share your content on relevant forums and communities.
- **Networking:** Connect with other experts in your field and collaborate on projects.
    

You can take a single tweet and turn it into a product.

You can take a blog post and turn it into 5 tweets.

It’s all up to you how you want to cut the cake.

Remember, consistency is key.

Show up regularly.

Create valuable content and engage with your audience.

**4. Monetize your knowledge**

You’d be amazed at how much money a basic eBook can generate, never mind a full-fledged course or coaching offering. Here are a few ways to make money from your knowledge:

- **Blogging:** Share your knowledge through blog posts and build an audience. You can monetize through Medium, Beehive etc.
- **Online courses:** Create in-depth courses on your area of expertise and sell them online.
- **Coaching or consulting:** Offer one-on-one guidance or advice to clients.
- **eBooks and digital products:** Package your knowledge into downloadable products.
- **Speaking engagements:** Share your expertise at conferences or workshops.
    

It really is as ‘simple’ as that.

You just need to focus.

I am sharing these lists with you because I wished someone had told me this earlier on in my career. That I could make millions in my 20’s. The conventional and old ways of saving pennies and investing it in real estate or the stock market no longer works. Investment is for those who have a hefty cash flow to invest. For starters, what I am about to share with you is the most accessible way to make millions in your 20’s and 30’s. If you lock in, your 2025 is going to be completely different.

After watching these YouTube lectures and practicing the lessons for 6 - 18 months consistently and you don’t become a millonaire, come back and I’ll refund everything you spent. And I hope after today, I have opened your mind to a whole new world of infinite possibilities.
