Most people waste their life jumping from one thing to another,  from one trend to another, never truly committing to anything. This is what I call **The Shiny Object Syndrome.**

You don't have results to show for anything because

- You set goals but never start
- You feed your distractions from social media notifications, endless emails, binge watching Netflix
- You get closer to finishing that project and leave it halfway
- Your business is not making progress because you have stopped improving yourself (personal growth is business growth)

You give yourself excuses why you never get anything done:
- time
- skills
- resources
- blame others

You're not a perfectionist. You're a procrastinator because if you truly wanted to get shit done you have what it takes.
  
You don’t need more time.  
You don’t need more excuses.  
You don’t need more resources.  
You don’t need more experience.  
You don’t need more connections.

One advice that has contributed to the success of my career is to stop overthinking and just start.

That's the simple yet powerful advice you need when faced with the daunting question of "How do I start?"

People use this question as a procrastination tactic, a way to delay taking action until they feel fully prepared or have all the answers. But the truth is, you'll never feel completely ready, and there will always be unknowns along the way. So instead of getting bogged down in analysis paralysis, start and figure it out along the way. Because honestly that's how every successful person starts

Sure, you'll hit roadblocks along the way. That's inevitable. 

Obstacles are opportunities to learn and grow. When you get stuck educate yourself. YouTube is free, Google is Free, Reddit is free, seek out solutions, and be willing to experiment and adapt as you go. 

Your mind is programmed at birth to see life in a certain way. Limits are imposed on your potential and so you see yourself as not qualified to take on the daring tasks in life which can guarantee your freedom from the shackles of society. You depend on everyone but yourself. When you encounter challenges, don't immediately turn to others for advice. Trust yourself to find a way forward. Trust in your abilities, your resourcefulness, and your resilience

## Pivot But Don't Quit

> Forgive yourself for not knowing what you didn't know before you learned it. — Maya Angelou

What you need to understand is that you are allowed to “start over” from a position of compounded knowledge. You’re allowed to start over from a better position, with transferable skills, and the new skills that sparked you to “start over.”

It's through taking action and facing challenges head-on that you'll truly learn and grow. So stop waiting for the perfect moment or the perfect plan. Stop waiting for permission to take responsibility for your life. 

Replace:  
  
• Doubt with confidence.  
• Distractions with focus.  
• Excuses with discipline.  
• Complaints with gratitude.  
• Procrastination with action.  
  
Your life changes when you choose to replace what holds you back.

## Awareness Begets Solution

You can’t improve what you aren’t aware of.
Awareness is the first step toward real progress.

You want to get more done, but distractions are everywhere—social media, endless emails, Netflix binges. Before you even realize it, hours slip away, and you’re left wondering why your to-do list is still full.

The truth is: you can’t take action on what you’re not aware of.

### Plow Back Useful Time With 3 Simple Habits

You only have 1 hour a day.

Well, most people with responsibilities only have that much. If you’re young, you have one of the greatest advantages: time. Don’t waste it like everyone else your age.

If you don’t spend 1 hour building your dreams, you will spend 8 hours building someone else’s, for life.

If you only have 1 hour to build your own thing in the morning, then do only that and be okay with it. You don’t need to, and can’t, work 12 hours if you only have 1.

And no, successful entrepreneurs don’t start by working 12 hours a day on their projects. If they’re anything like you and I, which they are, they have a current life they need to exchange with gradual effort.

If you have more time, or are already deep into building your own thing, structure the rest of your work from highest to lowest leverage.


1. **Identify Your Distractions**  
Be brutally honest with yourself. What’s pulling your attention away?  
Is it your phone, notifications, or mindless browsing? Once you’re aware of what’s keeping you off track, you can start cutting it out.

2. **1 Hour of Focused Work**  
Turn everything off. No social media. No emails. No Netflix.  
Just one project. One hour. No multitasking.  You’ll be amazed at how much you can accomplish when your mind is fully locked in on a single task.

3. **1 Day at a Time**  
Stop worrying about all the things you need to get done by the end of the week or month.  Focus on today. What can you achieve right now, in this moment?

The formula is simple:  One hour of pure focus.  One project at a time.  One day of intentional action.

You’ll see results, but it starts with awareness. 

## Habit That Lead To The Good Life

You now have direction and awareness of why you aren’t achieving your goals

Now, you need to cultivate 2 habits to bridge the gap:

1. **Learning** – for novel information to fuel your skill acquisition and knowledge.
2. **Building** – to metabolize the information and build mental muscle.

Both are expensive tasks.

Start with 30 minutes of each a day.

30 minutes of self-education in the morning.

30 minutes of building a project that will contribute to your vision.

If you can’t set aside 1 hour each morning, when distractions are minimal, to build your future – go back to your first structure to get your priorities straight.

### Have A Longterm Plan

You are in this chaotic spot in life because of distractions.

The organization of your life (and therefore the mind) tends toward disorder if you don’t perform mental housekeeping.

This is dangerous because you can pick up bad habits along the way.

Habits are difficult to break.

But you can make the process easier with clarity.

Take 10 minutes.

Write out every single thing you are going to do for the next week.

This shouldn’t sound crazy or difficult.

This is how you reduce the friction of making better decisions.

Write out:

- Your morning routine
- Your focused work routine
- Other tasks and meetings
- Nightly routine

The hardest part is not giving attention to the negative thoughts that inevitably pop up when mediocre habits are threatened. Mindfulness is your friend for starting your new plan.

You will have to experiment as you go.

If the routine doesn’t flow, go back to your notebook and write what you’re going to do the next day.

This is how you create a system for your life.

You create a system for your life by mapping out your week, sticking to the plan, identifying problems, experimenting with solutions, and repeating the process until you reach your ideal future.

It gets more efficient with time if you make this ‘mental housekeeping’ a regular practice.

Before you know it, new skills will become second nature and you will be baffled by how far you’ve come.

### The Moving Levers Of The New Rich

You have two priorities:

- **Audience** – building an audience of people to remove your dependency on your employer, government, and any other centralized entity that controls most aspects of your life.
- **Product** – building a product so people can give you money in exchange for something that benefits their lives. This is the only way to take control of your income and stop relying on everyone else  but yourself to make you money. This is what I will teach in [Ideas To Profit](https://nas.io/checkout-global?communityId=63cca6ba6b6b7d12431df1eb&communityCode=CAREERS_IN_TECH&requestor=whatsappSignup&sourceInfoType=folder&sourceInfoOrigin=65be06725d542ebc015ba2b9).

I find it quite funny that the one question all beginners ask is “How do I make money?”

And when they’re given the only answer that will actually make them money, they ignore it and go after “faster” methods of making money that are reserved for people _with_ money like investing, crypto, startups, and the rest.

You make money by starting a business.

You make money by distributing a product with a price tag on it so people can pay you for it.

Thinking that you don’t have to build a product is foolish. I know some of you will only understand this if I’m harsh with you… so, stop being a dumb ass and finally realize that you need a _product_ and _people_ in the form of an [audience](https://nas.io/skillembassy/challenges/0-10k-sprint3) to _pay_ you for that _product_.

Then, and only then, once you have a minimum of Ghc 10,000 to Ghc 30,000 a month should you think about investing capital as leverage to make more money from it. This is not a hard rule, but it’s wise to treat it as one so you maintain some sense of order in your mind in this journey. Don’t get distracted.

Cash. Flow. First.

Freelancing, agency work, information products, I don’t care. I recommend what I recommend, but just start something. You probably don’t have a few hundred thousand cedis (without destroying your life with loans) to get rich like the few who did in older generations.

We live a digital world with more resources, more efficiency, and lower costs so more people can generate wealth _in that space, the digital space._

## Build Systems into Your Routine To Ensure Your Business Growth

Content is the drive behind small and big companies.

Someone asked me how I am consistent on creating such valuable content every day.

I told them how I use my [writing system](vhttps://nas.io/skillembassy/products/lsyr) to come up with valuable content over the weekend, save them in my writing vault and schedule them in batches.

In less than 2 hours.

This wasn't initially by choice.

I have contract work with businesses while building my online business.

So this forces me to maximise the limited time I have.

Because as much as I like to hustle, I need a life too.

So if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed maintaining consistency online - feel free to use my system.

_Let's go through the steps._

**Step 1: Braindump tasks**

Create a new label in Google Keep

Write all the tasks involved in your content creation process.

Don't worry if you miss something, we'll refine it later.

Your list might look something like this:

- Research content ideas
- Write content
- Create images / graphics
- Schedule content

**Step 2: Break down tasks**

Now you want to flesh out the components of each task.

For example:

_Research content ideas_

- _Save 10 relatable content from Quora_
- _Bookmark 5 top-performing tweets from inspirational creators_
- _Screenshot productivity content ideas from Pinterest_

**Step 3: Identify relevant tools**

_What can you leverage to make the process easier?_

I've set up a writing Template that I use to write these newsletters, longform and shortform posts.

I leverage each social media platform's inbuilt scheduling feature and batch post my contents.

This is how I stay consistent even though I work on other projects and sometimes traveling between cities.

**Step 4: Start testing**

The system won't be perfect off the ground.

Start using it to create content.

After going through the creation process a few times, you'll identify roadblocks.

**Step 5: Refine**

Find areas that can be improved and tweak them accordingly.

For example, I initially thought creating content according to each content pillar was the most logical order.

But I quickly realized our brains aren't always logical.

It didn't match with the order that ideas came to me.

Instead, I choose the content idea based on research from others.

Then I combine this with my own personal experience.

That's how I make my content unique.

So that's all I'll leave you with this week.

I hope this helps. Thanks for reading.
