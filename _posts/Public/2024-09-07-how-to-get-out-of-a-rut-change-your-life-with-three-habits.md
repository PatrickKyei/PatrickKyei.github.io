_I am writing this Letter as the ideas flow, forgive my typos if you come across any._

> Most people, even though they don’t know it, are asleep. They’re born asleep, they live asleep, they marry in their sleep, they breed children in their sleep, they die in their sleep without ever waking up. They never understand the loveliness and the beauty of this thing that we call human existence. – Anthony De Mello


It’s a shocking realization.

People coast through life on autopilot. They follow the script society handed them at birth, never questioning if there’s more.

Most people will never wake up to the beauty of their own existence. They never understand the depth, the magic, and the loveliness of what it means to truly *live.*

Most people are following the same script society set  for them.

The moment you are born and you are taught to use your first meaningful words you told to go to school, get a job, get married, have kids, retire at 65 or whatever age and wait for your death.

Now let me ask you — how much of that journey was conscious?

How many decisions were made with full awareness, with a deep understanding of the *why* behind each choice? 

For most people, life happens *to* them. They live out the expectations society has placed on them. They’re asleep, just going through the motions.

To live a meaningful life you need to be aware of the choices you make, where those choices are leading you and have a why behind every choice you make.

Society is a behavior system. It will condition you to follow a set of beliefs, rules and make choices which we all know the end results are the same.

The social fabric is a groundless web of ideas that allows society to operate cohesively.

The government and culture influence the school system. The school system creates resources for students to learn from. The students don’t question what they’re taught. The students go on to be parents. The parents teach their children what they know and send them to school. The children make friends and conform further to fit in. The children grow up, get jobs, become teachers, become parents, become politicians, and create the knowledge and resources online and offline that influence culture. The parents, students, and children vote. The cycle continues to create the society we live in.

Your mind is programmed at birth to see live life in a certain. Limits are imposed on your potential and so you see yourself as not qualified to take on the daring tasks in life which can guarantee your freedom. 

You depend on your parents for what you wear.

You depend on your friends for what affiliation you should join and career path you should choose.

You depend on your government for jobs and your daily bread.

You depend on everyone but yourself.


## Experience Life On A Grand Scale

The essence of experience, life, and science is trial and error. You cannot take ideas, opinions, or advice as law without the filter of direct experience. Even if that advice is my own. 

When reading this these letters, hold all of what I say in the realm of possibility until filtered through direct experience. You need to make mistakes through action: identify problems, solve them, and make your process more efficient by creating a system that you can follow, spot novel problems, fix them as they arise, and evolve when the system inevitably loses its power to get results. Systems allow us to invest our mental energy in a more efficient manner through problem-solving on the path toward our goals

If these goals, systems, and problems along the way are not conscious, you can imagine the consequences. Humans are creatures of habit. 

Without a conscious goal, we will pursue one that makes survival seem easy and comfortable, leading to expectations that don’t align with reality. Without a conscious system, we will adopt the habits, beliefs, and opinions of those around us and utilize them to reinforce our unconscious path in life. Without making the problems that arise conscious, we will adopt a victim mentality, reject our ability to change who we are, and have our attention manhandled by others’ goals. 

Without questioning our path in life, the “safe and secure” route that is marketed to us at birth and beyond will become the default option. Beliefs are conditioned into our habit-loving brains. Beliefs influence our thoughts. How we interpret those thoughts influences our state of mind. Our state of mind influences our actions. Our actions compound into our future self. Our future self may not be one of our own creation, and that is the source of the concept of evil.


"Let's build a system to keep them busy! 
That way, they will forget about their dreams and life goals!"

If you feel like you're stuck in a cycle. Wake up.

Work. Sleep. Repeat.

The system is designed to keep people occupied — so busy that they forget to question *why* thy're doing what they do every day.

Do you ever wonder if the routine you keep everyday is keeping you away from what you're really meant to do? 

You are programed to "follow the path" society set for you if you don't question anything.

Go to school.
Get a "stable" job, 
Retire EARLY at 60 or whatever.
Live a boring life and wait for your slow death.

What if this lifestyle is a distraction from your *true purpose*?

> "There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you." — Maya Angelou

### A Call To Wake Up

1. **Stop living on autopilot.**
   - The first step is realizing you’re asleep. Are you making choices that *truly* align with your values, or are you just following the crowd?

2. **Question everything.**
   - Every decision, every belief, every habit — is it yours, or is it something you’ve inherited from the social condition you find yourself?

3. **Dare to do more.**
   - Face your hard truths, break free from the script you have been assigned, and find your own path. This is the only way to live fully.

4. **See the world with fresh eyes.**
   - The beauty of human existence isn’t in the mundane routine. It’s in the small moments — the conversations, the sunsets, the laughter, and the challenges that shape you.

Discover the beauty of *conscious* living.

If you don't make your own choices, take responsibility of your life, you'll be told what you want and you'll believe it.

Your existence is a gift — don’t waste it in the dream of someone else’s making.

If you want to live a life that has not been lived, you cannot follow the default path that is laid in front of you at birth. 

> "if you get on the wrong train, be sure to get off at the first stop. The longer you stay on, the more expensive the return trip is going to cost you."

Don't just follow the crowd. 

## 3 Habits That Will Transform Your Life

You must puncture the default path you have been conditioned to live.

Most people close their minds at the first hint of difficulty.

When you stick through the increasing difficulty of a situation, eventually you break through to a state of enjoyment

Since you don’t treat your ideal future as a necessity or interest, situations become more difficult than they are. Don’t fight with it, flow with it.

What you need to understand is that you are allowed to “start over” from a position of compounded knowledge.

You’re allowed to start over from a better position, with transferable skills, and the new skills that sparked you to “start over.”

If you are still working toward the same big and broad goal, like financial freedom, you are required to pivot along the way.

If you give up on that big goal, you are giving up on your future. Not good.

Knowledge compounds, skills compound, good habits in general compound.

This is why I am a big advocate of a personal brand and [micro business solutions](https://nas.io/skillembassy/products/gyjm). Your interests change. Your skills, knowledge, experience, awareness, and network compounds. You are a human. Humans evolve. Your business evolves with you if you follow this path. In fact, it is the vessel for accelerated evolution.


### Reading. Read to Gather Ideas 

> Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave

Humans are pattern recognition and learning machines. Since we were born, we absorb ideas like a sponge and adopt groups of ideas, or ideologies, as law. This narrows our mind and limits what we perceive as important.

Society gets to us early, because most people are mindless, and the friends, parents, and teachers that condition our minds had theirs conditioned by their friends, parents, and teachers. Few people have a self that is a conscious personal creation through critical thinking, self-generated goals, and forging their own path.

At a young age, we transcend the need for physical survival. We don’t have to worry about it as much. This is where something more dangerous comes into play: conceptual survival or surviving the idea of who you are.

This is easily noticeable across religion, politics, and niche communities like coffee drinkers. If you are conditioned into a religious belief system, you will feel threatened when someone challenges those beliefs. Like a mouse in the binds of a snake, you will lash out and attempt to reproduce the ideas in your head by telling them they are wrong.

 Party A and Party B are in a war of opposing ideas they are attached to. 
 
 They feel physically threatened when someone challenges their beliefs.
- If your favorite sports team loses, or somebody says they’re a bad team, how do you feel? Is your survival actually at stake? Or do you not see how silly you are being over a fabricated idea?
- When you gain weight, do you stress about the physical weight on your body? Or do you stress that the idea of your identity as a healthy individual will die?

You are surviving and reproducing your identity through words and actions in every situation. If you did not create yourself, you are furthering the spread of mindlessness, evil, and destruction without even knowing it. And you probably don’t even care.

If we want to create an identity that works less, earns more, enjoys life, and has its ideas ripple through the Universe to create heaven, it will be painful.

Think of your “self” as an intellectual structure. A house but not a home. When you go to remodel a house, you don’t rip the foundation out and watch it fall. You make small and strategic changes as you become aware of problems that ruin the aesthetic and function of the house.

To change who you are, you must solve problems in alignment with the goals you create, not the ones that are assigned to you.

That’s how you live with purpose.

Start superficial so you can stop living in a narrow-minded state of stress. Fix your health, fix your money problems, fix your relationships, and then dive into the depths of your ever-evolving purpose.

Most people don’t “find their purpose” because they don’t see the purpose staring them in the face. You must solve the burning problems that are preventing your mind from expanding beyond surface-level living.

You do not have one purpose.

You move from lesser to greater purposes with time, effort, and evolution of who you are.

Reading is the ultimate life-hack for productivity.

It rewires your brain, expands your perspective and fuels your creativity.

Reading is how you discover ideas beyond your mental conditioning. But most people stop learning after graduation. The school system made hate reading.

Schools don’t prioritize curiosity, so most people hate learning by the time they graduate.

Learning is the foundation of the human experience.

Hammer it into your head that you must be learning something, anything, every single day. No matter if it’s for 10 minutes or 3 hours, your future depends on it.

How else are you going to discover new opportunities if you don’t first learn about them? How are you going to act on opportunities that don’t exist to you?

When you stop learning, your life stops progressing. You stop growing. The psychological benefits and feel-good chemicals stop flowing. Life gets mediocre and repetitive. You become mechanical and robotic.

My goal is to get you interested in reading.  
  
It will completely change your life.  Because it did mine.  
  
Don't stop reading after graduation.  
  
School made you hate reading.  
  
You were forced to read books you were not interested in. 
You were forced to spend hours on books that had no impact on your life. Now you have the chance and choice to read high impactful books that you find interesting. If you start a book and you are not finding it interesting, skip to the next one. This is life.  
  
If you hate learning, it’s safe to say that you have lost a lot of zest for life.  
  
Learning is a fundamental human drive.  
  
- Without it, activities aren’t as enjoyable.  
- Conversations aren’t as meaningful.  
- Your days feel repetitive and lifeless.  
- You don’t see your future changing much from the present.  
  
If you want to create a fulfilling career, have better relationships, become more intelligent, rediscover life’s depth, and slow down in this busy distracted world…  
  
Read.

#### Read 3 books

One that builds your mind.
One that builds your business.
One that redefine your relationship with life.

I’m always reading 3 books.  
  
• One for business growth  
• One for personal growth  
• One for Value Creation  
  
Current reads:  
  
• The 2 Hour Agency  
• Atomic Habits  
• Second Brain

I know that CHANGE takes time. It will take you some time to adapt to this lifestyle but you put in the effort.

Meaningful change does not require radical change.

Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.

And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big.

Each time you get tiny results it teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself

To become the person that you want to become, you need to build your identity through consistent habits.

This is a gradual evolution.

We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new.

We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.

### Write. Write To Organize Ideas

Writing is how you make the unconscious conscious.

Writing is how you pull your deepest thoughts out of the fog and into the light.

Writing is how you gain control over your mind instead of letting it control you.

They’re programmed to exist in the game of life. They wake up, work, consume, sleep, and repeat, never once stopping to question their thoughts, actions, or beliefs. They have zero conscious thought. 

You can interact with them, but they remain the same. They never level up

**What separates those who level up from those who stagnate? **

To develop your conscious thought you need to write. 

Writing forces you to organize your mind. It forces you to take the chaotic mass of thoughts swirling around in your head and give them structure.

Humans fill their day with activities that structure their minds.

To brush your ideas up against reality:

- Write to dive into the depths of _one_ idea
- Start with a common problem, steps or a story to overcome it, and the transformation that occurs from doing so (this is the structure of both human behavior, storytelling, and [profitable branding](https://nas.io/challenges/0-10k-sprint3))
- Sit with the ideas that stem from your writing and refine them

When you organize the ideas that you read through writing, you can [monetize your ideas](https://nas.io/skillembassy/products/gyjm). Build solutions when you solve the problems you encounter in your life.

**Here’s what happens when you write:**

1. **You clarify your ideas.** Thoughts can be messy. They bounce around without direction. Writing brings clarity. When you put something on paper, you can see it, evaluate it, and refine it.

2. **You challenge your assumptions.** Writing lets you question your own thoughts. You can see where you’ve been programmed by society, where you’ve accepted beliefs without ever asking, “Why?”

3. **You unlock new levels of understanding.** As you organize your ideas, new connections start to emerge. Insights you never noticed before suddenly become clear. This is how you level up. 


Most people stay stuck in the same mindset, repeating the same patterns for life.

Writing is the tool that breaks that cycle.

When you write, you stop being a passive player in the survival chain. You start thinking, questioning, and understanding at a deeper level.


#### Make Your Thought Process More Intentional

I believe there is a basic lesson here, which is that we are living in a time of rapid change and it is all too easy to become so distracted that you stop being productive.

And you might get so preoccupied that you lose the ability to focus on what is truly important.

When we say that understanding how to think is just as important as knowing what to think about, we're talking about lessons on how to structure our thinking and create routines that help us to stay focused on the most important things.

> Writing builds mental networks which essentially give us the space to think about the right things. - Patrick Kyei

The thing that differentiates the most productive people from everyone else is that they have routines that forces them to think about what's happening a little bit more.

So, in addition to every morning, one of my major contemplative habits is to write down my thinking process, record thoughts that come to me, and subsequently put it somewhere I can see it and think about it a little bit more.

> I've discovered that writing down my thoughts helps me comprehend why I have that idea; it forces me to think a little more thoroughly, such as, "why did I believe this idea an absolute truth?" And while they might be difficult at times, they have proven to be the most significant.

### Build. Build To Expand Ideas

The worst aspect of death is to die with your ideas, that would have impacted the world in no small way.

Men are builders. If you are not building something You are another thing. Build your career. Build your body. Build your business. Build your empire. Build that thing you always want to build. Time is running.

From a young age you are trained to depend on everyone but yourself. 

I've heard many people say that entrepreneurship isn't for everyone.

The statement that “everyone is not meant to be an entrepreneur” is false.

It’s a form of bad mental conditioning that keeps people stuck in a cycle of dependence.

You've been sold the idea that entrepreneurship is for a select few. 

That only certain people have what it takes. The rest? They should stick to working for someone else, following the path laid out for them. 

This is limiting belief. It’s a mental framework designed to breed interdependence on others instead of empowering people to carve out their own paths.

I am here to present to you a different argument.

The truth is, everyone has the potential to be an entrepreneur.

**Entrepreneurship is not about starting a tech company or building a billion-dollar empire.**

It’s about:

- **Problem-solving**: Recognizing a need and creating solutions.
- **Creativity**: Taking a new approach to old problems.
- **Independence**: Gaining control over your time, resources, and life.

We all have these traits within us, but society conditions us to think otherwise.

**Here’s why the "not meant to be" mindset is dangerous:**

1. **It conditions you to settle for the bare minimum.** If you believe you’re not cut out for entrepreneurship, you’ll never push yourself to explore your own potential. You’ll be content to let others dictate your career, income, and life trajectory.

2. **It fosters dependency.** You become reliant on other people’s vision and direction. Instead of developing your own ideas and solutions, you follow someone else’s plan.

3. **It stifles innovation.** Everyone has a unique perspective and insight. By discouraging entrepreneurial thinking, we limit the flow of new ideas and solutions that can come from anywhere.

> Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy. — Dale Carnegie

Challenge the default conditioning.

Start thinking like an entrepreneur. 

Everyone has the capacity to build, create, and innovate. Don’t settle for the idea that it’s not for you—because it is.

Embrace an Ownership mentality.

Take control and create the future you want, ditch the victim mentality.


Thanks for reading.
