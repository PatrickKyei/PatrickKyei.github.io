Reality is a game. 

There are winners and there are losers.

Life is a game and your character determines the outcome.

Your character is not set in stone.

That’s the first realization you must make.

You have to be very particular in the way you see the world around you.

Until you change the way you look at life, life won't change the way it looks at you.

Quite literally.

Because you are reality. You are the universe.

You are your own U-niverse.

You can change.

No matter how painful.

No matter what your mind tells you.

No matter what society tells you.

No matter how much you want to stick to the comforts of your current life that are causing more destruction than you think.

You can alter your present character in the game of life.

Your character is your concept of self: who you think you are.

A combination of ideas, beliefs, experiences, and information you’ve processed that compose the operating system from which you interact with reality.

For most people, their character was created for them.

## Mental Impregnation 

In our childhood, every single one of us is a product of our environment.

The fundamental human drive to learn allows us to soak up any and all information that will contribute to our survival.

With this information, we are set on a default yet mediocre way of life.

Like a flock on a downhill, if we don’t learn to carve our own path we may end up heading towards a cliff.

The fate of humanity is not guaranteed.

This is the case for every life form.

If we do not make intelligent and conscious choices, we may eradicate ourselves from the face of the Earth.

This is the worst-case scenario, but it is an ever-increasing possibility.

Our character determines our actions.

Our actions contribute to society and culture.

Society and culture influence the programming of other characters.

The ideas, beliefs, and information that compose the form of our character will be spread through our choices to form other characters.

The collective character will determine its own fate.

It all starts with an individual’s ability to wake up from their mediocre trajectory, change who they are, and let their actions impact the world.

## Society Is A Construct Of Systems That Conditions The Minds

The social construct is a groundless system of ideas that allows society to operate cohesively.


The government and culture influence the school system. The school system creates resources for students to learn from. The students don't question what they're taught. The students go on to be parents. The parents teach their children what they know and send them to school. The children make friends and conform further to fit in. The children grow up, get jobs, become teachers, become parents, become politicians, and create the knowledge and resources online and offline that influence culture. The parents, students, and children vote. The cycle continues to create the society we live in.

Your mind is programmed at birth to perceive life with a limited consciousness. Limits are imposed on your awareness and so you see yourself as not qualified to take on the daring tasks in life which can guarantee your freedom.

You can't make progress because you tie your identity to external superficial things. 

Like a job title, a political affiliation, religion or radical ideology.

So even when you have to make a change that can alter the progress of your current chaotic self, your ego is threatened.

If I said you could start a business and remove the limit on your earning so that you can actually do what you love, your identity rooted in your subconscious mind in the corporate rat rac will be threatened. You'll attempt to give all the excuses why you can't start a business. Label a business as a bad thing when it is the most holistic endeavor you can take to achieve true financial freedom for yourself and your unborn generation.

> When I criticize a system, they think I criticize them – and that is of course because they fully accept the system and identify themselves with it. — Thomas Merton

This is easily noticeable across religion, politics, and radical groups. If you are conditioned into a religious belief system, you will feel threatened when someone challenges those beliefs. You will lash out and attempt to reproduce the ideas in your head by telling them they are wrong.

Yes if you want to start a [business,](https://nas.io/skillembassy/products/gyjm) build a personal brand. 

There's a reason why most business owners are using LinkedIn, Facebook, X heavily and encourage their employees to do the same thing. A personal brand is the driving force behind successful businesses. 

A LinkedIn profile is becoming a default requirement on job application forms. 

The most accessible way to make millions of cedis is staring you straight in the face but your limiting mind is raising questions in your head, by the time you wake up, the golden opportunity has passed you. 

Unless of course you want to practically work for a boss for the rest of your life, which to me sounds stupid. Yes, almost everyone will start from a job which is fine. I am not saying working a job is bad but do not bank your life on it. Build a [brand](https://nas.io/skillembassy/tusf) so that you can remove the limit of relying on someone from paycheck to paycheck from your life, so that you can eventually do what you love. 

Do not tie your identity to anything external.
Not to a job title. Not to a political affiliation. Not to a religion. Not to a radical ideology.

Your identity should not be defined by the labels society place on you.
When you anchor who you are to external constructs, you lose the ability to think and act freely.

Your decisions become biased, filtered through the lens of something that does not align with your own life experience.

This is why so many people struggle to make meaningful progress. Because they cannot change. They are stuck in their shell of comfort even if they can see it is killing them slowly.


Untie yourself from labels. Detach from external influences. Root your identity based on direct experience.

## You Need A Mindsetshift

If you don't change your mindset you cannot change anything.

And you cannot improve your life.

Everything starts in your mind.

- New ideas.
- Better decisions.
- Stronger discipline.

That is why I am telling you that reality is not a physical game. It is a mental spiritual game.

You must first change the cause if you want to change the effect.

You first must change the mental dimension to change the physical dimension.

It is as within as without. The mirror does not smile before you do.

I get these common questions 

“Why do you always talk about mindset?”

“Why do you like talking about the mind?”

“Why are all your teachings on self-education and self-development?”

You see I talk to myself more often I talk to anybody. 

Self reflection is for deeper understanding of the Self.

I usually ask myself this question: 

“If I didn't have a, b, or c, would I still find value in myself?”

It comes down to the fact that the only thing likely to get you what you want is in life your mind.

Self-improvement is about solving problems in your life. 

Acquire the skills to solve the problems in your life, which is an automatic filter for value.

A strong mindset is the foundation of success and resilience.

When everything else is reset to zero, your mind is what remains. It's your most valuable asset. 

Invest in it, protect it, and continually upgrade it.


## The 6 Desirable Process To Change 

To change who you are, you must solve problems in alignment with the goals you create, not the ones that are assigned to you.


Most people don't define their purpose because they don't see the purpose staring them in the face. You must solve the burning problems that are preventing your mind from expanding beyond surface-level living.

You move from lesser to greater purposes with time, effort, and evolution of who you are.

1. **Intention:** Change starts with a decision. You set the intention to become something greater than you are right now. The seed is planted.


2. **Behavior:** Action follows intention. You begin shifting your actions to align with the person you want to become. One small change at a time.


3. **Habit:** Repetition creates habit. Your new behaviors become automatic, woven into the fabric of your daily life. Change no longer requires conscious effort.


4. **Practice:** You continue to refine your habits, practicing them until they become more natural. Consistency is the bridge between progress and mastery.


5. **Second Nature:** The shift is undeniable. What once took effort now happens with ease. Your actions reflect the person you’ve been striving to become.


6. **Ideal Self:** Over time, you embody the version of yourself you once only imagined. The change is complete, and you’ve become the person you set out to be.

Your outer world mirrors your inner state.

Build mental models that deconstruct the conditioning on yourself by society.

Develop your discipline muscle, challenge your limiting beliefs, and practice self mastery to gain control over your thoughts. 

As your mental state sharpens, your decisions, habits, and outcomes will align with the life you want. 

Transformation starts in the mind.
