I have sent more Letters this week than I have ever done.

I launched a 60 Days Challenge for myself to get better at writing and I am surprised how I am pulling through.

After going through the series, I am amazed at the value I have passed across to over 600 people just within a week.

I love challenges. Challenges make me grow. You need limits to find yourself. So I set goals that challenge every area of my life. Health, wealth, relationships. And I make every effort to meet them.

If I knock a goal off, I set new ones to order my consciousness.

You need goals to challenge your limits to discover your potential. To find new opportunities in your life.

You need self generated goals rather than the goals society set for you:

go to school
get a job
get married
retire early at 65
survive on some meager pension
try to enjoy your boring life and then hope that one day you die

Since childhood you have followed a definite script that was handed to you by parents, friends, teachers, religious leaders and the society. Do this, do that, don't do this, go here, stay here.

Living by society's script isn't fulfilling. It’s predictable, mundane, and often leaves you questioning your purpose.

Create goals that resonate with your true passions and aspirations. Society’s checklist is outdated. Design your own path.

Break free from society norm:

Discover what excites you and turn it into a goal.

Focus on continuous learning and self-improvement.

Seek long term experiences rather than short term satisfaction .

Build a career that aligns with your passions, not just a paycheck.

We are in an Information Age.

You have access to endless information to educate yourself. Information not found in schools.

Education not found in schools is the source of income not found in employment.

To succeed in this modern day and age, you need to reprogram your mind from the mundane goals of society that puts a limit on your mind and potential.

Without self-education and self-experimentation, you go through life on autopilot. Like robots on an assembly line. Doing what you have been programmed to do without question.

Listen to what I have to say:

The next phase is going to help you develop systems and strategies for you to discover yourself, set your own goals and follow your passion.

I am going to pull this from one of the Letters. It might sound familiar if you've been following:

It is very common for people to fight or disregard what they don't understand.

When you don't understand something, open your mind to understanding. Be curious, research, dive deeper into the subject.

That is what smart people do.

As at today, it is impossible to run any successful mega business or earn a 7 figure income if you conform to your old programming.

It is nearly impossible to break away from the trap of a 9-5 job that steals away your precious life, without self education and a personal goal.

Nothing worth having is predictable. If you are reading this, you weren’t meant for the conventional path that everyone goes down.

You know there is more to all of this — and hopefully I have opened you up to the possibility of more in your life.

Uncertainty will have you in your head, a lot. Embrace this. Muscle is built from resistance, tension, and ample recovery.

Information leads to awareness of opportunity.

Awareness of opportunity leads to profitable ideas.

Profitable ideas lead to positive behavior change.

Ideas begets ideas.

You have to constantly educate yourself and chase good information.

Develop the habit of reading.

This is the only way to discover life changing ideas.

Your mind is an idea generation factory.

The best gift you can give your brain is the habit of reading.

It's like a mental workout that strengthens your critical thinking muscles and expands your perspective.

Hunt for good information.

Our thoughts, emotions, and actions — which are all forms of information — dictate our experience, which is information in the form of feedback.

You see, the human mind needs ordered information to keep itself, well… ordered.

Not mindless entertainment and self deprecating memes.

You don't have ideas because you don't read.

Most of the things you seek are hidden in the pages of books.

The answers to most questions in your heart are hidden far between the pages of books.

It would only be revealed to you when you start reading books.

Have a vision that is going to order the direction of your life in the next 10 - 20 years. Set 10 year goals, 6 months goals, weeks and days goals.

Pick 3-4 interests and search for information on them. Educate yourself. Research. Ask questions. Share your findings.

I’m always reading 3 books.

- One for business growth
- One for Value Creation
- One for productivity

Current reads:

- The Diary Of A CEO
- Build a Second Brain
- Atomic Habits

**1. Start Small**

Begin with 10 minutes a day. Pick a book that genuinely interests you and commit to reading a bit each day. Consistency is key.

How I trick myself into reading when I don't

have the strong urge to:

I tell myself I'm only going to read for 2mins.

Easy enough right?

After starting, by default I want to make more progress.

So I end up reading for 30 minutes, an hour or for hours instead of 2 minutes.

**2. Create a Routine**

Incorporate reading into your daily schedule. Whether it’s in the morning with your coffee or before bed, make it a non-negotiable part of your day.

**3. Diversify Your Reading**

Don’t limit yourself to one genre. Read fiction, non-fiction, biographies, and even poetry. Different perspectives spark diverse ideas.

**4. Set Goals**

Aim to finish a certain number of books each month or year. Track your progress and share your for accountability.

**5. Join a Reading Club**

Find a community that share common goals. Discussing your findings can deepen your understanding and introduce you to new perspectives and opportunities.

The more you read, the more ideas you’ll generate.

Create your own education hub.

Feed your mind. Water your mind. Don't allow your mind to die.

When everything is taken away from you, your mind is the only thing you have.

The right mindset makes everything right.
