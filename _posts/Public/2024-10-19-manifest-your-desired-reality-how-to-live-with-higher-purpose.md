I didn't grow up in the presence of my dad. 

> "The true horror of existence is not the fear of death, but the fear of life. It is the fear of waking up each day to face the same struggles, the same disappointments, the same pain. It is the fear that nothing will ever change, that you are trapped in a cycle of suffering that you cannot escape. And in that fear, there is a desperation, a longing for something, anything, to break the monotony, to bring meaning to the endless repetition of days." — Albert Camus, The Fall

When I was young my dad wasn't around that much. I kinda saw him once every summer vacation when I traveled with my mum so that I could see him.

I was very young, I didn't understand the dynamics of these things — relationships, marriage, love and all that. But I grew up to understand that they divorced and they didn't stay together.

At one point my mother travelled to work in a different town so that she could support my education and us.

So one good thing was that I never had anybody to tell me what to do, ever. I had to figure everything out for myself. 

And I think that helps a lot. It makes you high agency. Throughout my early years I lived with people; my aunties, church members and some few friends. The grown ups didn't impose their idealogies. Their lifestyle also didn't have any impression on me. There was nobody saying this is right, that was wrong, do it this way, don't do it that way. So you figure it out for yourself.

It started with reading and it eventually just goes to thinking. I think that deep down everybody wants to understand things.  

Everybody wants to learn, everybody is curious. If you spend a day with a child they will use half of the time to ask questions. It's our primal instinct. 

## Just Keep Asking Questions

When I went to high school people gave me many names. 

Some said I was "controversial" , "archaic" , "old school", and "difficult to understand" 

I simply had a curious mind and I feel many people aren't used to that. You couldn't get me to buy into just any idea without me trying to first probe holes in it to find out if the idea holds water. You couldn't ask me to follow anything blindly — I will ask why. 

> Don't rely on second-hand information to make judgement. Always think from first principles when you can. You might have fewer ideas, but each of them is more sound and stable than what other people tell you. —Erica Xu

Your mind is the operating system for reality.

When you learn how to think, you learn how to effectively navigate situations for the most advantageous outcome to your life and others. To put it in another frame, when you learn how to think, you get what you want out of life.

I was often pained and frustrated trying to understand why people would consider me as controversial when I was simply trying to understand the world I live in. 
"Did they just expect me to accept their ideologies as the reality for my life just like that?"

"Are people also not been controversial in that case?"

It didn't make much sense to me.

## Reading Was The Gateway For Me

I fell on reading as a way to get the answers to the questions people failed to give me. And even if they tried to provide some sort of help, trying to answer my questions, they were so biased about it that the answers didn't hold any value anymore.

Books became my friends (that's probably why you often see me talking about reading books ). It helped me get out of my dark times and I feel if I got that kind of result from it why not share it with the world? This is how these Letters were born.

If you didn't find me reading, you'd find me with a notepad writing. 

I will not go for entertainment programs in school even when I knew it attracted punishment. I will not go for sports events. I will avoid all social gatherings unless it was compulsory. But one thing reading does is that it puts you on a path of self discovery. So I have learned and unlearned many life patterns throughout my life up until this point.

My love for reading exposed me many high agency people who feel the pull and know there's more to this life than just the superficial news that bombard our screens everyday. If you feel the same pull you should join our [community](https://nas.io/skillembassy) for just $5 bucks. I am calling all those who feel the pull to join the next big revolutionary change to make big impacts in our own small way.


> “You are not here just to fill space or to be a background character in someone else's movie. Consider this: nothing would be the same if you did not exist. Every place you have ever been and everyone you have ever spoken to would be different without you. We are all connected, and we are all affected by the decisions and even the existence of those around us.” — David Niven

Why am I telling you all this?

The world is full of people trying to pretend they have their life figured out together and they will shut you off in any slight opportunity. 
Don't be a push over. 

Value yourself, your voice, your body, your opinions, your dreams, your pride, your ego. You have a right to take up space.

Yes too much reading without action or reading the wrong thing is however bad too. Because you'll stuff your head with the wrong thing and create mental obesity which will inevitably create another life you won't like to live in.

You want to read and build with your best ideas.

So you want to read what I call [High Value Books]([https://nas.io/skillembassy/kpsv](https://nas.io/skillembassy/kpsv))


Up until you turned say 18 or 20 society has infested your mind with beliefs and ideologies that limits what opportunities your mental frame is able to capture. Like rodents and insects infest a house and collapse it's foundational structure, the foundations of your reality have been collapsed into the chaos of your mind. You don't see opportunities even if they are dropped right on your lap.

**You need to do a mental housekeeping.**

The fabric of reality is composed of units of mind.

The opportunities you see, and the ones you act on, are filtered through the frame of your mind.

If that frame has been collapsed by societal programming and ideologies, you'll struggle to recognize opportunities, let alone seize them.

Your mind is the lens through which reality is shaped.

The clearer and more independent that lens, the more potential you’ll unlock. 

## Reprogram Your Mental Frame


Society dictates what we perceive as true, possible, real, purposeful and fulfilling.  There has never been a more harmful approach to creating a society of people who are shepherded to the end of the cliff as sacrifices for evil to continue.

Work and fulfillment is defined by society as something that one has to slave at to find meaning and live a purposeful life. 

The traditional definition of work is redefined in every generation. 

Once you internalize this and begin to polish the skill that is involved with making your creative work a success, you start seeing benefits you didn’t even know you were after.
### 1. First Principles Thinking

First principles thinking if you don't know what that is, I invite you into a curiosity loop.

**First principles thinking** is a powerful tool for problem-solving and innovation.

It involves breaking down complex issues into their fundamental building blocks and reasoning from there. This is what it looks like...

1. **Examine the principles that underline the problem.** So like why you don't make enough income to sustain your basic life. Why can't you make money. You ask  a series of why questions until you get to the basic root cause. Which could be that you don't the skills to solve creative problems. People easily give their money to people who solve their problems.
2. **Question assumptions** and think creatively.
3. **Generate novel solutions** using fundamental principles.

Now when you take this approach you have 

- Deeper understanding of the world 
- Novel and creative solutions 
- Durable and lasting solutions

I can suggest some strategies for applying first principles thinking. But do not take this as the general rule. Apply it, test it, refine it until you can have your personal experience to conclude that it works or not..

1. Start from scratch
2. Break things into smaller pieces 
3. Embrace failure as an opportunity
4. Challenge the status quo

Anyone can use first principles thinking to solve problems and understand complex concepts more deeply. So that you don't take what society inject into your brain as rule. You create your own principles in your life for clarity to achieve your goals.

It forces you to ask the most basic questions and challenges your own biases:

- What do I really know to be true?
- What is at the core of this problem?
- What are the undeniable building blocks I can work with?

It breaks every problem down to the core and removes the fluff.  It forces you to deal only with raw, essential truths. And from those truths, you rebuild a new way of thinking, a sharper lens for navigating the realities of life.

The first principle approach to problem solving has been applied by various innovators and entrepreneurs of time like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Franklin.

When Elon wanted to build SpaceX, he didn’t start by asking, “How do we build a cheaper rocket like everyone else?” Instead, he broke the problem down to first principles. He questioned the cost of materials, labor, and why rockets were designed a certain way. This mindset shift allowed him to see an opportunity where others saw only limitations.

> I think it is dangerous not to have conversations. I mean, a healthy prolonged process of talking to another person ( or a group of other people ) that forces you to confront the biases in your reasoning, the gaps in your ideas and the porosity of your convictions.

To build a life you can be proud of, go back to what first got you here.

> We can't solve problems by using the _same_ kind of _thinking we_ used when we created them. — Albert Einstein

### 2. Curiosity Based Learning

> "Every child is born a genius" – Albert Einstein. 

But if a fish is judged by it's ability to climb a tree, it'll live it's whole life believing that it's stupid.

When I first started on this business journey, it was out of curiosity.

I was observant.

I observed those I didn’t want to be like, and observed those I did.

The contrast between the two became very clear to me at a young age, around 17 years old at this time.

On one side of the coin, people were:

- Unfit
- Unhappy
- Unwilling to change

A lifestyle chained to a weekly paycheck.

On the other side of the coin, people were:

- Living their dream
- Spreading a great message
- Inspiring people to be better

I let my curiosity pull me down different interests so I could learn what they were all about.

When my mates spent time at entertainments night, I would go to a friend's house, because at the time I didn't have a computer, run a computer program and spend all my time fascinated by the nuances of the application. I remember I was particularly interested in the Encyclopedia, there was an old software like that. I think that was partly because you could read all the fascinating stuff on science, history, the galaxies and different continents. It was so cool.

Curiosity is the engine behind every discovery, every breakthrough, every opportunity you’ll ever see.

When you rely on the traditional school system, you are fed information. You take notes, follow instructions, and memorize facts. Curiosity-based learning flips the script. It’s the process of *wanting* to know, not just needing to know.

When you approach life with curiosity, you reprogram your mind to:
- Ask better questions
- Seek deeper answers
- Challenge the status quo

Instead of passively accepting what’s given, you actively chase knowledge. This type of learning keeps your mind open, adaptable, and always searching for the next connection. It’s where creativity thrives.

Think of Steve Jobs. He was a very curious child. Curiosity drove him to learn about design, typography, and calligraphy. These weren’t skills he *had* to learn, but they became essential pieces in creating Apple’s innovative products. His curiosity led him to connect dots others never thought to connect.

Opportunities hide in places most people overlook. A curious mind connects the dots and unlocks new solutions.

To become a Digital Renaissance Man (or Woman), you will be learning a variety of skills and interests that pique your curiosity.

The evergreen skills allow you to package up and distribute those skills in a profitable manner.

A few YouTube videos will suffice in learning the fundamentals of these skills (don’t ask for recommendations, just go learn).

After, you must learn to apply those skills to whatever path you choose.

If you want to start freelancing or coaching, consider [Ideas To Profit](https://nas.io/checkout-global?communityId=63cca6ba6b6b7d12431df1eb&communityCode=CAREERS_IN_TECH&requestor=whatsappSignup&sourceInfoType=folder&sourceInfoOrigin=65be06725d542ebc015ba2b9). If you want a masterclass of systems on becoming a creator (the embodiment of the Renaissance Man) consider [The Value Creator Masterclass](https://nas.io/checkout-global?communityId=63cca6ba6b6b7d12431df1eb&communityCode=CAREERS_IN_TECH&requestor=whatsappSignup&sourceInfoType=folder&sourceInfoOrigin=667351f34c7b56ab306a2881).

Courses aren’t necessary if you make the time to study, experiment, and fail. But, they are obviously helpful for those that want to streamline their efforts from somebody who has already done it.


### 3. Direct Experience


Thinking is important. But action is where the magic happens.

> Many believe a man should be like the biggest rock in the river, unmovable and tough. But I don't want to be the rock. I want to be the water—fluid, adaptable, and always moving forward. Rocks can withstand, but water finds a way. — Spartan King

You can read every book, watch every tutorial, or study every concept under the sun. But if you don’t *apply* what you’ve learned, it’s all theory—nothing changes. Direct experience realigns your interests with your goals.

Action creates clarity.

For mental clarity, it’s helpful to avoid over consumption of:
- news 
- videos 
- courses
- tv shows
- podcasts
- social media 

You have enough thoughts to think through.

Imagine you’re learning to ride a bike. You can study balance, physics, and motion for years, but the moment you *actually* get on that bike is where real learning happens. You wobble, fall, adjust—and eventually, you master it. That’s how action shapes your understanding of reality.

Experience is the best teacher because it grounds abstract ideas in reality. When you take action, your brain creates new neural pathways, rewiring itself based on the feedback you receive. With each new experience, your mind becomes more tuned to spotting opportunities in the real world, not just in theory.

The more you act, the more you train your brain to see what's possible. You’re no longer stuck in analysis paralysis or waiting for the perfect moment. You’re out there, learning, failing, adjusting, and growing. That’s how you reprogram your mind—through action and direct experience.

### 4. Learn and build in public

There’s a new game in town for creating income—*learning and building in public*. 

 You can no longer work behind the scenes and expect to get the results you anticipate in your business.
 
Share your journey, your process, and your progress with the world. You'll attract the right audience to your product. If your product is great and solves the real problems of people, you can cash in big time.

You aren’t aware of your potential because you haven’t been exposed to it.  
  
You haven’t been exposed to it because your environment is completely known.  
  
The unknown is the land of possibility.  
  
You must expose yourself to new career paths, health paradigms, and social circles.  
Realize the knowledge and skills you must acquire to change your life. Writing, marketing, sales, fitness, nutrition, communication, and the rest.

Thanks for reading.
