__I would recommend that you read this with an open mind. Remove sentiments and emotions__

The clear path of going to school, getting a job, and retiring happily is enticing. So, you relinquish your freedom to choose and do what you’re told.

Everyone is creative.

Creativity is about achieving any goal with the knowledge and skill available to you, not fancy art or designs.

In other words, you need to learn how to set self-generated goals, utilize the internet, mentors, and the abundance of information you have access to to educate yourself.

Then, you need to embrace trial and error, self-reflect, and experiment to create your own path. (Days ago I shared a perspective on how society trains people to fear failure)

Creativity gives you the power to do whatever you want in life.

Those who don’t realize this gift are doomed to the assignments of others.

You can no longer rely on your boss to generate attention, attract customers, and assign you some measly work for a set amount of money to fulfill the product or service to those customers.

Don’t rely on a paycheck for your survival.

Transcend your survival through entrepreneurship and remove the earning limit from your life.


## What should beginners do?

Labor has been around since the first biological being entered this grand game of survival.

Capital is a more recent invention.

In essence, capital as leverage means that you can spend money to make more money.

You can invest in businesses, real estate, stocks, or crypto.

You can invest in resources that take work off of your hands.

You can invest in information that allows you to avoid costly mistakes, make better decisions, and become more efficient with your time.

You spend money to make more money.

The problem is that most people are broke in more areas than finances.

They don’t have enough cash flow to make investments that pay them anything notable.

Even worse, they get locked into a mindset thinking that putting aside a few hundred dollars a month and budgeting away every lost penny is going to make them rich.

Even even worse, they think they can get rich quick off of new opportunities like crypto with the allowance their mom gave them.

These have their place, of course, but in my eyes, they’re quite stupid and uneducated decisions.

Why would I save a few hundred dollars a month to make 1 million in 40 years because of the scarcity mindset my parents gave me when I am well aware that average people are starting internet businesses and making that much in 1-3 years of focused effort?

Then, when and only when I have ample cash flow, I can use capital as leverage to compound my earnings.

Rather than waiting 40 years for stock prices to rise (and letting inflation catch up), I want to make a few million a year with a business I see as my life’s work and turn that into 10s of millions by the time I’m 40.

In conclusion, capital as leverage is great, but not for beginners.

That leads us into our final option. One that you should not take lightly. One that you should not see as “just a phase.”


All new fortunes are being built in the digital space.

Build a [personal brand](https://patrickkyei.com/fullstack-writer)

It’s the easiest path for beginners to take control of their financial future.

All you need is:

- An internet connection
- A few ideas
- The ability to stick it out until the end

The best thing you can do to achieve freedom build your skills and your brand.

That’s your insurance for dark times.

Even if you lose all your money, you can make it back next month.


## How To Navigate The Digital Gold Rush

There’s a common piece of advice that goes around that I think is quite narrow and dumb:

_“Build something offline, then start online.”_

In other words, people don’t realize that social media (or the internet) is a perfectly viable way to start a business in today’s world. I’d argue it’s one of the best ways all things considered.

I don’t think it’s wise to unnecessarily go through the pain and suffering of building a brick and mortar business, or a physical service (like pest control, car detailing, etc), or even freelancing or agency work with endless hours of manual outreach.

Even then, those businesses can get on social media whenever they want to acquire customers. They don’t need to wait until they meet your standards of success before they start posting in the digital space.

It just doesn’t make sense to ignore social media as a way to attract anyone, connect with anyone, and build distribution for whatever your work is.

Of course, I recommend thinking for yourself, pursuing your interests, and turning that into a business with the right skill set.

I don’t recommend accepting someone else’s outdated business ideology that narrows your mind from seeing your potential.

In other words, I recommend choosing the problem you want to solve and the solution you want to provide. I recommend not even starting a business. I recommend treating any skill you learn, any problem you solve, and any solution you create as value that can be given to other people as your life’s work.

There’s no need to do anything other than solve the problems in your life, acquire the skill to do so, and pass down those lessons as content and products to earn a living doing what you enjoy.

## How to build a business for beginners in the New Economy

Business is a game of creating a great product or service and putting it in front the right people.

Yes, there are details in the marketing, promotion strategy, and other things… but people get too caught up in that.

If you want to start a lean business today 

*Build a personal brand through writing online.*

Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Create a Social Media Account**

   Start with platforms like X (Twitter), LinkedIn, or Facebook. These platforms offer great reach and networking opportunities.

2. **Optimize Your Profile**

   Use a professional photo, write a clear bio that highlights what you do, and include a link to your website or a relevant landing page.

3. **Solve a Problem in Your Life**

   Look at the challenges you've overcome or the skills you've developed. These are potential areas where you can offer value.

4. **Write About Your Ideas**

   Start sharing your 
   - thoughts, 
   - experiences, 
   - solutions to problems you’ve faced. 
   
   This builds your authority and attracts an audience.

5. **Teach People Who Are a Few Steps Behind You**

   You don’t need to be an expert to teach. If you’re a few steps ahead of someone else, you have valuable knowledge to share.

6. **Package It as a Coaching Session, Digital Product, Course, or eBook**

Once you've built a following and established credibility, start offering paid services. Whether it’s coaching, creating a course, or writing an eBook, your audience will be more than willing to invest in your expertise.


Building a [business](https://patrickkyei.com/monetization) doesn’t have to be complicated. 

Start small, be consistent, and watch your personal brand grow into a thriving business.



We are going to make this as simple as possible. We will discuss:

- Growing a social media brand
- Creating a product or service
- The best way to start monetizing
- The tasks / priorities you should be focusing on

Don't overcomplicate this.


A personal brand is the best traffic and lead generation mechanism.

- You build trust quicker
- You are your own niche
- You are your own USP
- You create content from experience
- You can pivot whenever you please
- It's fun

But how do we create an authoritative brand?


I'll spare you the whole:

- Professional profile picture (clickable)
- Bio that answers "What's in it for me?"
- Link that directs people to deeper content (selling something is even better, it shows you have created something of value)

This is a given.


But where is the depth behind the brand?

What is your mission?

- Your vision for the future
- Your goals for getting there
- Your values that align with followers
- What you have experience in
- What you are learning about

This is a personal brand after all.


Your job is to become a mapmaker.

Your content reveals areas on the map, like breadcrumbs, leading them from where they are to where they want to be.

Transformation focused.

You help them gain awareness of where they are now (pain points) and help them overcome those.


Without regurgitating what every social media growth guide says, the easiest thing you can do is emulate.

- What brand do you vibe with?
- How did they grow when they were your size?
- What are they selling? Does it actually sell?
- Can you recreate it with your own experience?

- What is their tone?
- How does their branding look?
- Have you dove into their funnel, emails, or other content?
- What aspect of their marketing sticks out? Have you swiped it yet?

Doing this alone will save you 3-5 years of trial and error.


"Patrick, I'm doing exactly what people say but I'm not growing."

You either:

- Aren't getting eyes on your profile
- Think your brand is better than it is and haven't taken the time to reflect and improve (or seek help and invest)


How do you fix this?

- Stop wasting money on stupid things and invest $1000/mo+ in paid growth (guaranteed eyes and sales if your offer is good, you should make 5x that back minimum)
- Create content that is popular, controversial, or so actionable that people have to share it
- Network with people around your size. DM them, make friends, mastermind, and help each other grow
- Find creative ways to get eyes on your profile.

(On Facebook: like consumer's posts that follow people similar to you. They don't get notifications, but they will from you)

Cool, you are growing now but aren't making any money.

1) Stop relying on the platform and donations to pay your bills, this isn't YouTube. Even if it was, you should sell something.
2) Start a service business. Freelancing, coaching, or consulting.

Again, this is a personal brand based on your experience.

Have you bought a book or course, saw results with it, and know you could help others with it?

Books and courses are just productized service offers.

Dissect their teachings and write down steps to get from point A to B


Here's an exercise:

- Pull out a piece of paper
- Draw a line down the middle
- "Your dream life" on the left
- "Your personal hell" on the right

Be ultra-specific and brain dump everything that comes to mind here.

This is firepower for both your brand and products.


"Your dream life" is your vision.

It is the "point B" that you are helping people get to.

Much of it can be turned into content.

"Your personal pain point" is what you and your audience are avoiding like the plague.

This forms community and the foundation for your offers.


You have some form of an audience, but even if you don't — you can start helping people for free to refine and develop this system for getting results.

Start with the people you've connected with while growing.

As they grow, testimonials from them increase in value. Long game.


Once you are confident in your system / steps for getting results via a freelance or coaching offer, start charging and refining your marketing.

Here is a quick marketing masterclass (aside from the one where you swipe what already works from your competitors)


1) Who would you enjoy working with? Create a customer avatar to understand them on a personal level

2) What is the *specific* result you are promising? Tangible result or timeframe.

3) You can promise any reasonable result if you guarantee to work with them until they reach it
4) What is the biological problem you are helping them solve inside the eternal markets?

Eternal markets = health, wealth, relationships. This forms the foundation of your positioning.

Example: Health coaching can help make more money in biz, fix relationships, etc.


Bonus yet effective areas of study:

- Life force 8
- Maslows hierarchy of needs
- Customer levels of awareness
- Levels of market sophistication

Having a deep understanding of psychology and human nature will save you.

(Use these for content and copy angles)

Once you know your offer will sell, create a simple funnel:

- Social media = traffic
- Intake form with awareness building and qualification questions
- Simple email sequence that follows up for 6-12 months spaced out
- Calendly to book a call
- DMs


Example of how this works:

- Write a thread related to your offer
- Pay for people to share it
- (Grow as a byproduct)
- Plug your intake form
- DM people that fill it out
- Let emails work magic
- Get on call
- Close for $500-$1500 until you raise prices


Your intake form and emails should do the work, but DMs are the cherry on top. Understand the fundamentals of:

- DM etiquette (don't be weird)
- The sales process
- How to handle a sales call
- How to close


If your thread gets good traction and your offer sells

100,000 impressions on thread
5-10 minimum book a call
Close 2 at $500
Write 1 thread a week

Boom, more than 100K a month.

This is only one strategy of many to make this work, but is pretty simple.

All you have to do is focus on growth, writing actionable threads, scheduling calls, closing, and delivering on your promise.

Focus on that.


Given time, you can productize the same system into a digital product.

- Launch when you hit 10-20K followers
- Automate product sales via email
- Turn product buyers into service clients
- Potentially double your income

As easy as you make it.

I'm sure I missed some stuff, but that's the gist of it.
