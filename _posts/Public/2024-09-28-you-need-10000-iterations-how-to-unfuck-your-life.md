Most people are poor.

They are not just poor in pocket.

Most  people are poor because of how they were brought up both in school and at home. They can't solve their own problems and so they can't improve their life.

They rely on everyone but themselves. This leads to a dull, mechanical, and mindless life.

> “Everything is created twice, first in the mind and then in reality.” Robin Sharma


Everything starts from the mind.  
Your thoughts shape your reality.  
If you are healthy or sick, happy or sad, rich or poor—it all begins up there.

People underestimate the power of their own mind.  What you take for granted is that your thoughts are the foundation for your life.  The choices you make in life are based on the information you are exposed to over a period of time.

I don't remember who said this exactly but I'm going to leave it here for you to ruminate on.

> What you think, you become.

Build all areas of your life.

Don't just be a bodybuilder. Build everything. Your mind, body, spirit, and character. But remember, you don't build a house in a day, or with a poor foundation, or without attention to detail, else you build a monstrosity. Aim for sustainable health, aesthetics, and utility.

- Thoughts of stress and anxiety manifest in your body, they start from the mind.
- Happiness isn’t found outside, it’s a state of mind.
- Money doesn’t start in your wallet—it starts in the mind.  A wealth mindset attracts opportunities and turns ideas into income.


Everything you want in your life all begins with your thoughts.  Your mind is the most powerful tool you have.

If you want a different result than what you continue to have everyday do not outsource your thinking to anyone.

## Take Control Of Your Thoughts

The mindset of this generation is weak and it troubles my heart.
  
Society continue to fry your minds with cheap entertainment and pleasure.

You numb your mind with cheap dopamine. You you lose your sense of urgency.
You have no desire for

- anything Noble
- anything of excellence
- anything of higher standard  

You settle for the bare minimum.

You were told to do what everyone is doing.

Go to school, get a job, buy the house, let 40 years happen, retire (maybe).

You achieved what someone else wanted, not what you wanted. That’s not intelligence, that’s blind stupidity. You failed to question your programming.

That’s not success, that’s complete and utter failure. Even if everyone around you perceives your material possessions as success, they are blind to the fact that you aren’t a unique human being. Your personality and self-image is a clone along with the masses of society.

Success, in my definition, is creating who you are. The quality, enjoyment, and satisfaction in your life is the byproduct of that.


## Clear Thinking Will Make You Fortunes

> "People don't have the patience to dedicate 3 years to building their own life, health, their own business, but they have the patience to work for other for 40 years"
  
Cowardice is the actual pandemic of the world.

Things that will destroy your chance at success before you start: 
- Fear of failure 
- Closed mindedness 
- Expecting it to be easy 
- Identifying with ideology 
- Setting too small of goals 
- Using your age as an excuse 
- Thinking you need more money 

Unfuck your life.

Fear is natural but don't let it bind you in chains.
Most people would rather stay comfortable than face the unknown.

You weren’t meant to be a passenger in your own life.  You were meant to design, build, and live with purpose.

If your thinking is clear, you'll attract money.


Money isn’t elusive.  It’s a byproduct of clarity.  
Clarity in your goals. Clarity in your decisions. Clarity in the value you create.

When your thinking is clear:  
You don’t chase money—  
You attract it.

Clear thinking leads to purposeful action.  
You eliminate distractions so that you can focus on what really moves the needle.

It’s not about working harder—  
It’s about thinking smarter.  Becoming a value creator. You solve your own problems, create solutions, and position yourself where the money flows.

## You Need One Bold Decision To Unfuck Yourself

It takes only one decision to completely turn your life around.  
  
In 2019 I was fed up with the progress I was making.  
  
Broke, out of passion, lacked purpose and felt bitter at life.  

One day I asked myself a simple question which changed the trajectory of my life and led to the point I am today: "What do I truly want."
  
I decided to do everything possible to change my situation.  
  
I worked hard to raise enough money to purchase my first laptop, enrolled in online courses and engrossed myself in learning, night and day.
  
At first everything felt like a bunch of disconnected nonsense. But I kept on. I sat there, in front of my laptop - reading and building different kinds of projects with the intention to launch at least one of them into a businesses.  
  
With my skills in design and programming, I launched my first business with my friend.  
  
Today we are [helping a lot of people gain practical skills to land high paying jobs or even start their own businesses.](https://skillembassy.org) 
  
You don't need fancy:  
  
• fancy notebooks  
• fancy courses  
• fancy gadgets  
  
What you need:  
  
• discipline  
• consistency  
• commitment  
  
There are many skills you can choose from and in less than 6 months, your life will change for the better.  
  
- Design  
- Writing  
- Coding  
- Marketing  
- Persuasion  
- Articulation  
- Entrepreneurship  
- Data Manipulation
  
Do your research and pick a skill based on what you want to achieve in life and how you wish to contribute to the world.  
  
Learning a high value skill isn't just a nice-to-have—it can change your life.  
  
I dare you to dedicate the next 90 days (3 months) of your life to learning a [High Value Skill]([https://nas.io/skillembassy/challenges/0-10k-sprint4](https://nas.io/skillembassy/challenges/0-10k-sprint4)) that will be beneficial and profitable to you for the rest of your life.  
  
The truth is, whether you dedicate the next 3 months to learning or not, the 3 months will come and go, and if you did not make any move, that’s your loss.

## Cultivate Productive Habits

The solution to an overreactive mind is adopting a productive habit.

If you want new ideas, read.
If you want to make better decisions, read.
If you want a stronger disciplined mind, read.
  
When you sharpen your mind, your life follows.  
  
Read more.  
Reflect more.  
Challenge your thinking.

Your mind focuses on the ideas, thoughts, and opinions you repeatedly expose it to. The books you read. The drama you love. The negative thoughts you drown in. The internet opinions that keep you glued to a screen. Mental habits determine your quality of life.

Without clarity in your thinking, you're easily swayed—  by distractions, setbacks, and every fleeting obstacle in your path.  

Challenge your mental programming. Reject the mindless path.

Yes some ideas will hurt your ego. When you expose your mind to new ideas that challenges the Self you have been programmed to live up to, it will make you feel really uncomfortable.

Your mind hates discomfort. But discomfort is a signal for something new. Something you haven't experienced before. A new potential that can expose you to a better life.

Humans are pattern recognition and learning machines. Since we were born, we absorb ideas like a sponge and adopt groups of ideas, or ideologies, as law. This narrows our mind and limits what we perceive as important.

Society gets to us early, because most people are mindless, and the friends, parents, and teachers that condition our minds had theirs conditioned by their friends, parents, and teachers. Few people have a self that is a conscious personal creation through critical thinking, self-generated goals, and forging their own path.

## Develop New Mental Models

If you understand what you're trying to achieve, how to get there, and the challenges you might face, you can find ways to make things work in your favor.

Clear thinking leads to purposeful action.  
Purposeful action leads to a meaningful life.

Everyone wants clarity, but most people are stuck in a mental bug of the script society handed to them.  If you lack clarity, every decision feels random, every action misaligned.


#### Habits that lead to clarity

Most of your problems in today's world are resource management problems. You have access to any information you need to do whatever you want. You can't focus for more than 30 seconds. You get distracted and quit after 2 weeks. You have the resources. You don't have the clarity.

One pattern I’ve noticed in productive people: They’re obsessive about maintaining their mental clarity.

1. **Declutter your mind:**  
   Start by cutting out noise—social media, mindless content, cheap dopamine.  
   This creates space for intentional thought.

2. **Define your purpose:**  
   What do you really want?  
   Without a clear target, you’ll wander aimlessly.

3. **Strategic action:**  
   Once your thinking is clear, your next steps become obvious.  You can act with intention, every move serving your bigger goal.

4. **Create momentum:**  
   Purposeful action creates feedback.  
   You start building confidence and direction. Small wins lead to bigger ones.

5. **A meaningful life:**  
   Consistent action aligned with your purpose leads to fulfillment.  
   It’s not the goal itself, but the clarity behind your journey that brings meaning.

Now this will require some work.

Recently I have decided to cut sugar out of my diet. But the thing is that I catch myself desiring it and going back to it once in a while. Old habits take time to fade out with new ones.

You need 10,000 iterations to instill a new habit.

Meaningful change does not require radical change.  
  
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.  
  
And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big.  
  
Each time you get tiny results it teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself  
To become the person that you want to become, you need to build your identity through consistent habits.  
  
This is a gradual evolution.  
  
We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new.  
  
We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.

You can't change 20 years of mental programming in 1 month.  Yet most people expect instant results, instant growth, instant change.

If yo want to make meaningful progress the most important thing to do is to start NOW. 

Now when the desire for change is strong.

As intelligently worded by **Paulo Coelho**

> **Change.** **But start slowly, because direction is more important than speed.**

It takes time to build anything worthwhile.  
  
We often forget this and get lost in a world where people chase instant gratification and cheap dopamine to numb their mind.

If you want to build a meaningful life, which start from being in control of your fitness happiness and finance build a business. 

We aren't building businesses in the 90's. Simple formula to start a business in 2024.

- Grow an audience through your brand.  
- Solve your own problems.  
- Package your solution as a digital product, e-book, course, consulting, freelance service to solve the problems of your audience.  
- Put a price tag on it.  
- Distribute your solution across your brand.  
- Boom! that's how you make millions.
