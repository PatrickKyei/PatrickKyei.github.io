You weren’t born to work 40 hours a week doing something you hate, numb your mind with endless scrolling, and wake up one day wondering where the time went.

When you’re bored, pick up a book instead of your phone and see where that simple habit shift takes you.

When you’re bored, pick up a book instead of your phone.

Your phone is designed to give you quick dopamine hits but books are designed to give you deep transformation.

One keeps you distracted. The other makes you dangerous.

## Information Leads To Transformation 

I don't know why people downplay information. 

My life drastically improved because I chanced on certain information very few people knew. Same for other people. 

Stocks. Crypto. Trading. Investment. Real estate.

Quality information leads to transformation. 

You won't change your life with a hammer and a chisel. It's information that will do the magic.

Learn to pursue and invest in quality information. Change comes at a cost.

Most people are clueless about how to make money these day. I bet you do.

Everyone was born with zero knowledge, zero ideas and zero information.

Your identity is a mental conditioning from your parents, teachers and friends.

Your identity determines what information your brain filter as useful and since you have not consciously exposed your yourself to new information, you don't see opportunities when you see one.

You don't have ideas because you don't read.

Most of the things you seek are hidden in the pages of books.

The answers to most questions in your heart are hidden far between the pages of books.

It will only be revealed to you when you start reading books.

If you want books to read this year, my personal recommendation will be

- Art of Laziness,
- Focus On What Matters
- Purpose And Profit 
- Ikigai,
- Atomic Habits

The best gift you can give your brain is the habit of reading.

It's like a mental workout that strengthens your critical thinking muscles and expands your perspective.

You struggle to make more money because you don’t stick your hands in the profitable rivers that surround you.

You can't make more money because you've accepted the limits of what's possible that society projected on you.

If you never push beyond what your parents, teachers, and friends tell you, then that becomes your potential.

1. Information brings awareness of opportunity 
2. Awareness of opportunity brings profitable ideas
3. Profitable ideas bring positive behavior change

Choosing a book over mindless entertainment and self deprecating memes is self discipline.

I’m always reading 3 books.

- One for business growth 
- One for Value Creation 
- One for productivity 

## Focus Is A Superpower In A Distracted World 

You don’t need to go on a 30-day detox or delete all your apps. Just change what you reach for during those small, idle moments.

Because boredom is a powerful signal.

Most people silence it with noise.
But boredom is your brain asking for stimulation with depth.

And books deliver exactly that.

One chapter can plant a seed that shifts your perspective.
One idea can spark a project that changes your income.
One story can open your mind in ways scrolling never will.

You don't have ideas because you don't read.

Most of the things you seek are hidden in the pages of books.

The answers to most questions in your heart are hidden far between the pages of books.

It will only be revealed to you when you start reading books.

Next time you're bored, don't escape—elevate.

Choose to read a book. Not because it's a harder thing to do to act as if you are disciplined, but because it's better.

That small shift might be the beginning of the version of you you’ve always wanted to become.

### Turn Negative Energy Into Experimentation

The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making.

The worst thing you can do is to sit around, hoping for luck to settle on your lap.

"Luck" favors the curious, the bold, and the ones willing to experiment.

8 years ago I was fed up with the progress I was making. I tried everything: design, coding, writing, sales, marketing until I discovered what I can't pull myself from.

Experiment with everything you can imagine. New jobs, new skills, new interests, new places, new people until you find the one you can't pull yourself away from.

Experimentation isn’t just a trial and error thing—it’s the process of uncovering what works.

And more importantly, what doesn’t.

The worst thing you can do is to follow the default path and keep spinning your wheels while there’s something better you could try.

A lack of experimentation isn’t caution—it’s complacency.

You are settling for mediocrity because you’re afraid to fail.

Smart people test, tweak, and adapt.

They understand this simple truth:
1. Every failure gets you closer to the thing that works.
2. Every experiment teaches you how to be better.

Waiting for luck is a gamble. Experimenting is a strategy.

It’s incredible how many people still believe you need a college degree to see any form of success. The conditioning runs deep.

If you don’t know what you want, you will be told what you want, and you will believe it.

## Order Your Consciousness With High Priority Goals 

You feel terrible because the priority tasks you set aren't getting done. The tasks start to pile up and - even worse - you aren't making progress. Both demotivate and trap you.

You feel terrible because you made a promise to yourself that you would do better, but you broke it too soon.

You feel terrible because you view negative emotions as a trap instead of an opportunity to acquire the skill of emotional intelligence.

You feel terrible because your actions aren't aligned with the goals of your ideal self.

You feel terrible because you are trapped on the surface. Same job. Same tasks. Same routine that isn't conducive to a better future. You haven't evolved.

You feel terrible because you don't know you can start over. You can drop everything and acquire the skills to handle the consequences. You can make a better choice.

You feel terrible because you're always on your phone. One of the most powerful tools known to modern man treats you as its slave.

The first step to feeling better is to reframe how you view your life. You need direction, clarity, and priorities to eliminate distractions and create focus.

For direction, create a goal. For clarity, create a path. For priorities, identify the string of problems that stand in the way. Fall in love with the creativity, thought, and purpose involved with solving the problems in your life.

>"You can't solve a problem with the same mind that created it." — Albert Einstein

To reach your goals, not someone else's, self-education is a daily requirement.

The difference between where you are and where you want to be is skill, not luck. You need a selection of top 3 books on your list and a goal that requires acquisition of new information to apply to.

If you want to learn faster, don't start learning. Start building a project that will achieve your goals. Too many people get trapped in tutorial hell, stacking useless knowledge as brain fog.

Start building, get stuck, and search with intent to find the knowledge that helps you move forward. That's how you cut through the noise when learning.

Your problems never go away, you just get better at solving them.

### Life Is Good When You Have A Problem To Solve

You are on the brink of evolution. You are forced to learn. You are forced to change your mind. If you don't, you stay the same, and may get trapped there for life if you can't learn the lesson that life is trying to teach you.

My edge is that I'm quick to cut things out.

Video games, Netflix, cheap dopamine drugs, alcohol, late nights, etc. I won't be the guy that tells you not to do these things or else I'd be a hypocrite. But if any of them get in the way of my goals, they're out. Gone. No question.

Take a look at the average person's lifestyle and it will make sense why they always feel miserable:

- 5 hours of sleep, 
- meaningless work, 
- broken relationships, 
- binging Netflix for 4 hours, 
- no exercise or movement, 
- diet filled with sugar and fast food. 

Avoid it.

Discipline is the strongest form of self-love

Give yourself 6 months. 

6 months of saying no to random meaningless invitations. 

6 months of unbroken focus on the big goal you've been putting off. 

6 months of removing yourself from the environments that keep you broke, unhealthy, and unhappy.

Discipline is not about forcing yourself to get things done. 

It's about having absolute clarity on what you want out of life. 

No distractions. Pure focus. Seamless action.

## Do This For 6-12 Months To Reprogram Your Life 

Learning to focus for just 2-3 hours a day could be the difference between staying stuck and replacing your income.

But here's the irony:
Most people are willing to work 40 hours a week for 40 years-yet think 3 hours of focused work on a meaningful project is _"too much."_

You're not held back by lack of time. You're held back by fragmented attention and energy leaks.

Your performance is mediocre because your focus is scattered. You dabble in too many things. You start and stop. You let distraction win.

But here's the truth:
You don't need more hours.
You need better use of your hours.

- Block 2-3 hours.
- Turn off your phone.
- Pick one high-leverage task.
- And do it like your future depends on it-because it does.

You can build a new income stream, launch digital product, grow a brand, or learn a life-changing skill in those daily hours.

Do that for 6-12 months, and you'll create momentum others won't touch in 10 years.

Plenty of hours in the day. What you do with them is what separates successful people from losers.

Thanks for reading.
