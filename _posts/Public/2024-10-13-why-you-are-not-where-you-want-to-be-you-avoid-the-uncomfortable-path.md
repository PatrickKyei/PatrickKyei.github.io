Your 20s will make or break your future. 

Of course there are outliers but for the vast majority of people this holds true. Dopamine and modern comforts have become so normal that 99% of the population is docile, just way too comfortable and heavily risk averse.

Most people are just too comfortable.
So comfortable that they've forgotten what it means to struggle for something meaningful.

Comfort breeds fear of the unknown.

The average person would rather stay in their comfort zone than take risks that could change everything.

> ".. if I can play some role in your life to help you go to a new place, I'd be happy, honored, and fortunate to do so.. " 

If Nothing changes, nothing changes. 

The population is asleep. They live in their sleep, they marry in their sleep, they die in their sleep.

You can't have self development without self awareness. You can't improve what you don't know. 

- What do you want?
- What are you good at?
- What are the things in life that make you come alive?
- What habit can't you pull yourself out of?
- How can you leverage it?

How you spend your days is how you spend your life. I mean how can tomorrow be any better than today if you don't do anything different today.

You will never change anything for the better unless you change the things you do everyday.

I am not saying leap from one mountain to another mountain. That's the problem with most people. When they hear change they think it means you have to live a completely different life. And so they reject the whole idea of change. 

But let me ask you, "How can you change your life if you fear change."


## Make Meaningful Change


> Meaningful change does not require radical change.  
  
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.  
  
And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big.  
  
Each time you get tiny results it teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself  
  
To become the person that you want to become, you need to build your identity through consistent habits.  
  
This is a gradual evolution.  
  
We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new.  
  
We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.

## You Need Clarity And Action Not Excuses 

7 years ago I thought about giving up my dreams.

I wasn't born into privilege.

I didn't have 'connections'.

So if it was as some say and it was all about who you know, then I stood no chance.

I had to face life and navigate the harsh course of life on my own at some point due to certain circumstances.

After I quit my job 7 years ago, I did a self-examination of all the things I didn't have, and all that I did have.

And created opportunities out of what I had.  
I chose discomfort severally, to work on the things I didn't have.

I spent my time night and day to acquire High Value Skills.

I'm the farthest thing from who I want to be, but everyday I take one step closer to becoming that person.

I'm putting in the work.

And have met incredible people on the Internet, navigating this life together with.

Because now I know that, it's not about who you know, or what you were born into, it's more about what you make with what you have.

### How To Live An Extraordinary Life  

> The person who risks nothing does nothing, has nothing, is nothing, and becomes nothing. He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love and live fully.
  
### 1. Learn and Build stuff.  
  
Educate yourself.  
  
When a question about a certain topic pops up, google it.  
  
Watch YouTube tutorials and documentaries.  Take A course.
  
When something sparks your interest,  
read about it. Read read read.  
  
Study, learn, stimulate your brain.  
  
Don't just rely on the school system, educate that beautiful mind of yours.  
  
Skills not learnt in school are the source of income not found in employment.  


  
### 2. Make tiny improvements  
  
You can't go to level 10 with level 1 habits.  
  
- Read one page a day.  
- Write one page a day.  
- Workout for 30mins.  
  
Then focus on getting 1% better every day.  
Minor improvements over time lead to big changes.  
  
### 3. Control your actions.  
  
You don't have to answer and react to everything.  
There are certain things you can't control.  
Reacting to everything around you is a sign of impulsiveness.  
Be proactive, not reactive.  
  
### 4. Try new things  
  
If you don't try new things, you'll miss out on awesome and fantastic adventures and experiences.  
  
If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you can do.  
  
Do what you do everyday all the time, you will always get what you’ve always gotten.  
  
Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.  

Right now is the GREATEST time to start.  
  
- Improving yourself  
- An online business  
- Setting up your future  
  
It will be a long time until the opportunity  
is this high again (as if that should be an excuse).  
  
You have the time and resources.

There are many ways of getting to the top where you don't have to lick anybody's boot for position, paycheck or contract offer. If you want an alternative where you are in control build a brand to position yourself for global opportunities.

## Sustainable, long-term clarity comes from 2 sources:

1) Self-generated goals in alignment with a conscious future.

2) Soceity-generated goals in alignment with an unconscious future.

One is created, one is assigned.

If we don’t want our life to be the product of someone else’s vision, we must take control of our own.

If you don’t set your own goals,  
Society will hand you a blueprint you never asked for.  
A blueprint built on mediocrity and mindless routines.

## Work On Things You Enjoy

Enjoyment comes from investing attention.

Pleasure comes from spending attention.

Investments are long-term.

Purchases are short-term.

Enjoyment is process focused.

Pleasure is outcome focused.

Enjoyment is progress toward a long-term goal.

Pleasure is achieving a goal without effort.

Our goal is to maximize the enjoyment in our everyday life. That’s all anyone is trying to do. But they don’t zoom out enough to create a perspective that is distraction-proof. They focus on what can bring pleasure right here and now.

We don’t want to get stuck scrolling social media, having mindless entertainment and winning arguments in the comments that lead to absolutely nothing but time wasted.

We want to act on our goals, build something beneficial in reality, and impact others in a way that brings enjoyment to our lives.

## Use The Potent Of Your Negative Energy

You need a vision for the future.

Why?

Because at every point in my life where I have made substantial progress (and enjoyed every second of it) I was hellbent on actualizing a vision I held in my mind.

People that have experienced the same know this power.

That’s why I write about it so much.

I want to understand it more.

I want to write to the point of having a process that helps more people create and actualize their own vision.

You need an **Opposite Vision** as a potent energy to go after goals.

In brief, it is how you realize what you don’t want.

The things you hate and don’t want as a part of your life.

Does this mean you can get rid of them immediately?

Of course not.

You can’t just quit your job or move out of your hometown if you’ve built an entire house of responsibilities around it. There is more on the line than just money if you quit your job. Be smart about this. Long term game.

To create your potent energy:

**1) Observe society as a habit** – Pay close attention to the people around you in any situation. Why do they do what they do? What is it leading towards? Are they somebody that you want to be?

It could be as simple as observing the groceries in their basket, observing their body, and realizing you don’t want to end up slow, overweight, and lazy through your shopping habits.

**2) Reflect on your past** – What are experiences that you never want to experience again? What were the lowest lows of your life? What caused them? Have you done anything to prevent that from happening again?

Make this a conscious practice in your life.

**3) Make a list of what you don’t want** – Pull out a notebook and get specific. This list should make you uncomfortable.

Keep this somewhere safe. When something new comes to mind, add to it.

**4) Realize where you will be if you keep doing the same thing** – You are your habits. Where will your life end up if you have the same lifestyle in 10 years?

Do you want that?

**5) Transmute that energy into a passionate vision** – What will you have to learn, build, and execute daily to avoid your anti-vision?

If you want to turn your vision into a brand, and your notes into content so you can build an authentic one-person business, [check Ideas to Profit.](https://nas.io/skillembassy/products/gyjm)

Now that you’ve created a specific opposite vision for your future, you’ve programmed your mind for pattern recognition.

Yes, it is helpful to get specific on what you want out of life, but I will leave that to you.

Take the time to write out your main vision. Get specific as to what your dream life looks like.

By doing this you allow your mind to register opportunities you would have normally missed.

Your vision may not be “strong” yet, but you cannot improve what doesn’t exist.

With your vision in the back of your mind, start executing a better future through education, practice, and building.

Thanks for reading.
