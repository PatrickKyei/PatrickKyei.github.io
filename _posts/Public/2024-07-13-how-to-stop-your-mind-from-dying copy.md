The modern education system is great at one thing:

Training people into replaceable jobs.

This was a realization I had after I completed high school. Burdened with the challenge of gathering huge sum of money to sponsor my education since my parents were among the average salaried worker group, I knew that even if I went to college, finding the right career for me wasn’t over when graduation came around.

I had 2 options if I wanted to make more than enough money to eliminate the problems that come from money:

Option 1:

Gather money anyhow I could and go to college

Climb the corporate ladder

Use my skills to build someone elses business

Sacrifice my wants and time for a higher paycheck

Option 2:

Dig deep into the wealth of information available

Curate information to build High Value skills

Use my skills to build my own business

Sacrifice my free time for leverage toward my goals

The current school isn't entirely non-functional… it has some great aspects to it — everyone should be on a similar page in terms of how we operate as a society.

But in terms of living as nature intended?

It’s a horrible solution for helping people find, learn about, and make a career out of something they care about.

The modern education system works against our creative potent that is wired for survival.

It pushes us to “chew and pour,” memorize, and get trained into a job that has nothing to do with what we spent learning and memorizing.

The other thing… mass education will never be able to keep up with the digital economy that continues to evolve at an exponential rate.

We need individuals that can educate in an exciting way for the coming generations — because the school curriculum won’t be able to keep up with the advancement in technology.

Bureaucracy, corruption, policy delays etc.

The government can’t and will not nurture a curriculum that gives individuals the tools that lead to the dissolution of the old economy.

The education system is focused on training people into jobs for its own benefit.

Schools can’t, and won’t, teach you how to build your dreams.

The current education system is intimately connected with the government, politics, and economy. Their conditioning process (education) is set up to keep these things going.

Anything that gives individuals power is a threat.

Self-education is a requirement on your journey.

Refine your thinking and beliefs
Intelligence can be defined as :

A general mental ability for reasoning

Ability to solve problems

A curiosity for learning (learning never stops )

Don't let your beliefs become you.

From childhood you have been conditioned to depend on others for your survival. Your freedom to live and express your creativity is stripped from you since you have to depend on other people for your survival.

This belief has spread like cancer in your homes, schools and the media.

Most people are brainwashed by channels, by algorithms.

We have unlimited information but limit our perspective.

Don't get stuck in a cage of what you assume you can become. Don't let the beliefs spread like cancer affect your mindset.

Don't fight for beliefs that are not even yours.

Do your own research. Check your blind spot for headlines that are hidden.

Open your mind to a world outside your own.

Stay curious, stay unattached and don't let breaking news break you.

Curiosity Drives Self-education. Discover Your Potentials
The first step to acquiring any skill or progressing in life is to learn. Learning is the step that comes after curiosity.

Learning is the first step to success in any given area. There is a reason your parents teach you during adolescence then you go on to spend 12-24 years in the education system. Thankfully, online education has and will continue to grow with specific knowledge related to anything you could ever want to do.

Design your own career
6 months is enough to:

• learn a skill
• start a career
• start a business
• start a relationship
• build your own wealth

6 month is enough

You don't need fancy:

• fancy notebooks
• fancy courses
• fancy gadgets

What you need:

• discipline
• consistency
• commitment

Pick the life you want and then design your work around it.

Most people pick their job first and then their life is the crumbs of what's afterwards.

Which is the default setting of society.

You were forced to know exactly what you wanted out of life when you hadn’t even had a life of your own.

You were forced to pick a course you didn't care about.

You were forced to study materials you didn't choose.

You were forced to memorize contents that had no application to your life

You were forced to spend hours on projects that had no benefits on your personal development

You were forced to choose a job you hate going back to every day

You were literally forced to choose something that seemed to “set you up for a good future,” or else you would pay the consequences.

That is backwards. Start with the end in mind.

Technology has opened doors for everyone to do what they want
The biggest flex isn’t money.

It’s living a life without an alarm clock buzzing at 6:00 a.m. for a job you hate.

True success is waking up on your own terms.

Having control over your time and energy.

There have never been more opportunities to create income for yourself than right now.

The digital age has opened doors to countless ways to earn a living on your own terms and not depend on anyone for your survival.

Learn high value skills.
Offer your expertise to those in need. This is how you exit the rat race.

Skills and entrepreneurship create freedom.

Entrepreneurship is modern day survival
Our ancestors used antiquate tools to hunt for their survival.

Technology has come to solve mundane and boring tasks so that we can focus on the most important tasks: creative work to hunt for our survival.

Entrepreneurship is modern day survival.

Entrepreneurship is how we solve problems with modern day tools for our survival.

You solve problems, create solutions in exchange for Value.

In exchange for Money.

Money is a universal exchange for value.

In short, how do you make money online? Actual money?

You start a business.

You need a product and customers.

Shocking, I know.

Your job, as a business, is to attract people to a product so they can hand you money in exchange for it.

Ask yourself this question:

"But where do I find people to solve their problems for exchange of Value (Money)?" Social media.

A personal brand is your digital portfolio
This is why you need a brand that will represent you in the digital space to sell your solution (product/service) to people in exchange for value (Money).

To reiterate, you are building an audience to have a traffic source to your products or the service you offer.

If you can solve a problem in your life, you have what it takes to start your own business.

If you can solve a problem at your job you are qualified to start a business.

A business is the only thing that can you give the power to do what you want. It is not just about money.

You need to update your mental software from “Get a job and do that for the rest of my life” as a default setting to:

get a job,

start a personal project

turn that project into a business

make enough money, leave my job

and focus on scaling my side hustle as the new path

You see, everyone needs money.

The easiest way? Get a job.

And 9-5 jobs aren’t bad.

However, it’s not optimal.

You might be earning a profit, but:

You’re not following your purpose by working a job you hate.

You’re not free if your boss calls you at night, telling you to show up tomorrow on your day off. If you say no, you lose your job.

You don’t have time to enjoy life

You don't get time to spend with family because you’re required to work like an animal.

You start smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol to “get rid of” the stress.

You may not have been able to avoid a job altogether, but you could sure as hell get out of it before other life responsibilities start to pile up

If you didn't get anything at all from today's update, I want you to keep this in mind: business is people.

Build where the people are.

Gathering information is fantastic, but if you want to avoid the fate of a starving artist, you have to do more than just gather knowledge — you have to build.

Build a business which is your life's work.
