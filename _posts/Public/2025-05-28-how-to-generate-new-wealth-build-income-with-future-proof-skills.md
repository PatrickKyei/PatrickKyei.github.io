Today, starting a [business](https://selar.com/fullstack-creator) is the most accessible way to financial freedom.

However it is way difficult to start a business in say, real estate or investment. The capital to start is huge.

This is what I meant when I wrote:

![richest people](/assets/img/richest-people.jpg)

"The richest people in 90's:

- Owned oil
- Owned land.
- Owned factories.

The richest people today:

- Create content
- Own audiences.
- Use leverage

The internet changed the rules."

...where most people misunderstood it and shut their curiosity off. It got the traction it needed though.

I don’t deny that real estate is a decent option for people who have money, but for beginners who are still trapped in their parents’ ideology of investing every last penny while being forced to stay at a boring job to fund their delusional chances of getting rich… it is not going to happen. At least not on any meaningful timescale where you still have a life to live.

My point is this:

Most people don’t know what to do to generate new wealth.

I would argue that you do know. You’re looking at it right now. But you still have the “consume and save” mindset that limits how you perceive the gold rush happening right in front of you.

## How To Build New Wealth, Where To Start.

All new fortunes are being built in the digital space.

All new fortunes are being built in the digital space.

Build a personal brand

It's the easiest path for beginners to take control of their financial future.

All you need is:

- An internet connection
- A few ideas
- The ability to stick it out until the end

The best thing you can do to achieve freedom is to build your skills and your brand.

That's your insurance for dark times.

Even if you lose all your money, you can make it back next month.

The rich and wealthy of our time are all taking advantage of social media.

Cristiano Ronaldo has

- 636M Instagram followers
- 170M Facebook followers
- 112M X(Twitter) followers
- 32M YouTube subscribers in record time

We're at a critical moment in history.

It is very good to have a skill or posses a technical skill but if no one knows what you do, people can't partronize you.

The Internet has given everyone the opportunity to do what they love.

If you don't promote your work, talent, skill or business, no one will patronize you no matter how good you are.

Build where the people are – build in public.

There aren't many shortcuts to wealth creation, but this is one of them.

Do what you love but study psychology, marketing, writing and sales so you don’t become a starving artist.

A quick insight on breaking free:
Entrepreneurship is the natural step after self-improvement. You acquire a skillset and mindset so valuable to your life that you can’t help but share it with others. You solve your own problems, sell the solution that changed your life, and improve humanity as a result.
I see employment as a stepping stone.

Jobs are useful for skill acquisition, status, and opportunity.

But getting stuck in one is dangerous for your psyche which is wired to hunt. You become a monkey in a cubicle. It is against your nature.

## Entrepreneurship Is Modern Survival.

Entrepreneurship is modern survival.

- Set a goal.
- Find a problem.
- Learn how to solve it.
- Document how you solved it.
- Distill into a replicable process.
- Give it to others that want to be helped.

Do it offline and it's called growth.
Do it online and it's called business.

If you can write, speak, market, and sell you no longer have to worry about the outcome of your life. All you must do is use those skills to create your path.

The future-proof skill stack:

Ai
Sales
Design
Writing
Agency
Speaking
Marketing
Persuasion
Articulation
Web design
Copywriting
No-code tools
Email marketing
Entrepreneurship
Data Manipulation
Personal Branding

Learn to collect, create, and communicate value and you will become irreplaceable.

##Solve Your Own Problems. Sell The Solution.

The easiest way to build an independent income source is to solve a problem in your life, document the solution, and use your personal experience to market it. Writing helps you achieve that.

When you stop hiding what you have to offer and put yourself on the market, only then does your luck increase beyond 0%.

Marketing, sales, and persuasion are neutral until put in the hands of the mindful or mindless, authentic or corrupt, good or evil.

## Punch The Skeptical Beliefs.

_“Having followers on social media won’t pay your bills._

I always laugh when I hear this.

Because it always comes from people with no audience.

So I tell them:

..well, it pays my bills pretty well

And it’s changed so many people’s lives.

Some examples:

- Book deals
- Career growth
- Speaking gigs
- People finding a new job
- People building communities
- Founders finding investors

An audience or readership or just distribution in general is how you get a job without a job board, sell a book without a publisher, and make music without a record deal.

Luck is a percentage that increases with the number of people that know your value.

We aren't building businesses in the 90's. Simple formula to start a business in 2025.

Grow an audience through your brand.

Solve your own problems.

Package your solution as a digital product, e-book, course, consulting, freelance service to solve the problems of your audience.

Put a price tag on it.

Distribute your solution across your brand.

Boom! that's how you make millions.

A robust, comprehensive brand can put your career on the fast track;

- create content around your niche
- get community support
- build your brand and
- ensure your profile and activity clearly
- communicate the value
- get seen

Be you, learn to persuade and you get to skip ahead of those that lack distribution.

You can literally make millions doing creative work and doing less of manual labor with the internet and social media.

But of course, you need to learn how to monetize an audience to get there.

Thanks for reading.
