Most people are sheep. 

Since the day they were born, they do what they're told. Question nothing, believe anything. This isn't bad. Sheep can be happy, but fulfillment is another story. Don't let them project their lack of vision for the future on you.

You'll mostly be misunderstood when you start trying to think for yourself. Society will question your decision to take the narrow road. 

## Society Is A Behavior System

From the moment you were born, you were conditioned to _fit in_ society's script.

Parents reward you for being “good.”  
Teachers reward you for following instructions. Jobs reward you for compliance. The system isn’t built to produce free thinkers — it’s built to produce _obedient citizens._

Society breeds conformity.

Humans are social creatures. We seek belonging and fear rejection.  
Society exploits this instinct through institutions — school, religion, mainstream media, and work.

School is the first training ground:  
You sit still, memorize, obey. You’re graded not for originality, but for accuracy. You’re taught that failure is bad, not that it’s how you learn.  
By the time you graduate, your creative edges are sanded down. 

You’ve been conditioned to seek permission before acting — “Will this be on the test?” becomes “Will my boss approve this?”


When everyone follows the same script does that not produce the same result?

- Go to school  
- Get a job  
- Climb a ladder  
- Retire if you’re lucky

The fabric of society is a system optimized for _predictability,_ not _potential._  
People stop asking what they _want_ to do and start asking what they’re _supposed_ to do.  

The reward for conformity is job security. The cost of conformity is becoming an NPC. *Non-Player Character.*

In video games, NPCs are background characters.  
They follow pre-written scripts.  
They say the same lines.  
They walk the same routes.  
They never question the world they’re in — they simply _exist_ to keep the system running.

Now zoom out — and look at society.

Most people are conditioned to live like NPCs:  
They wake up, go to work, follow routines, repeat opinions they heard online, and never question whether the path they’re on was actually _chosen_ by them.

They’re not “bad people” — they’re just _running a script_ that was programmed by into their mind by school, culture, and fear of judgment.


When you conform too deeply, you stop being the player — you become part of the game. The idea of a secured safe path is drilled so deeply into you mind. You become intolerant to opposing worldviews. And even when a life changing opportunity is sold to you — like starting a business — you argue against it with your whole being because it threatens the identity you've been conditioned into.

If you are a program running in society, an NPC, and you have the goal to get a high-paying job, your mind won’t register starting a business as important.

This seems harmless on the surface, because “not everyone needs to start a business,” but it goes much deeper than that.

> Do whatever you want.
> 
> "When you do, you will make mistakes. At that point, if you are smart, you no longer want it, and begin to slowly course correct toward what you really want. If you always do what others want for you, you will never discover what you want." — Dan Koe

Over time, people lose touch with their own interests, creativity, and purpose. The pursuit of passion is replaced by the pursuit of stability.  

And stability — while comforting — rarely leads to fulfillment.


## Develop An Ownership Mentality

Most people never give a second thought to the fact that they tie their self worth to a career path set out for them by society.

> “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” -  Carl Jung

The truth is you don’t need permission to pursue your own goals. You need courage to break free from the behavior system that keeps you average.

### Tap Into Your Creative Ability To Build With Modern Tech

There are only three kinds of people when it comes to having direction in life.


![[newsletter-illustrations_20251010_180402_0000.png]]


1) People who don't know what they would like to do.
These people are often confused. They lack a strong sense of purpose.

2) People who know what they would like to do but don't do it.

These people are usually frustrated. Every day, they experience the gap between where they are and where they want to be.

3) People who know what they would like to do and do it.

The third kind of people know themselves, possess strong passion, grow in areas that help them move closer to their purpose, and do what they were created to do.

If you want to maximize your max all areas of your life — health, wealth and relationships, you must explore the Unknown.

Here are questions to help you start working through that process.

a) Do you like what you're doing now?
b) What would you like to do?
c) Can you do what you would like to do?
d) Do you know why you want to do what you would like to do?
e) Do you know what to do so you can do what you want to do?
f) Do you know people who do what you'd
like to do?

There is a direct connection between discovering your creative edge and reaching your potential.

To be successful, you must possess a deep sense of your unique abilities and aspirations.

There are two great days in a person's life: the day you were born and the day you discover why. Most successful people don't follow the crowd, they take the narrow path, bank on their creative ability and reach a growth point majority of people only dream of reaching.

Seek what you were put on this earth to do.

Then, pursue it with all your effort.

### Use Negative Energy To Your Advantage 
  
The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making. I wouldn't drown in the negative energy. I would channel it toward building something great. 99% of people are trapped because they see negativity as a bad thing. It's supposed to be there. It's a part of life. Learn to use it for good.

7 years ago I was fed up with the progress I was making, I asked myself one question, "How can I make my life better?" 

I explored new skills I was interested in. I allowed my curiosity to guide me into the unknown to identify new domain of mastery.

I spent 6 months to learn high Value Skills.

Today we are helping a lot of people gain [future proof](https://Skillembassy.org) skills to land high paying jobs or even start their own one person businesses. 

In one year, you can:

• master a specific skill.
• build productive habits.
• broaden your knowledge base.
• improve your overall quality of life.
• earn your first dollar on the internet.
• connect with like-minded individuals.
• gain clear insight into your vision and goals.
• create thousands of different opportunities.


You have to build your own thing. 

Business is modern-day survival. Your psyche is wired to hunt. You are neuro-biologically rewarded for hunting for your survival, not for being a monkey in a cubicle. Hunt for money to ease survival-induced stress & open room for creativity.

The internet is the hunting ground. Employers, wealthy businessmen, and like-minded people all have one thing in common: You can't reach them physically, but you can reach them online. You have to become valuable, learn modern skills, and display your value in public.

The internet is a free public school, job board, and journal. Replace distraction with education. 

Replace endless resume submissions for [building a brand.](https://patrickkyei.com/fullstack-writer)
Replace suppressing your opinions for attracting like minds. 

This is how you attract opportunities to yourself without relying on luck, "destiny helper" or waiting on the government to _save_ you.

The difference between you and what you want is skill. The worst perspective you can adopt is to think that opportunities are limited to the rich and lucky. If you don't have the results you want in life, it's because you aren't skilled enough.


Your "luck" is a percentage that increases with the number of people that know your value. Your value is determined by your skill set... the level of challenge you can take on. Profitability is determined by the number of high-level challenges you take on.

There is no end. Start making mistakes, because you have to realize this through experience. The "quick fix" mindset has been conditioned into your mind. The problems don't go away, they just get easier to handle. You're in this for life. Appreciate that fact.

Humans are goal-oriented creatures. Goals frame our attention, and if you don't create your own, you will drift towards societal goals and status games. Even if you do nothing, you will adopt unconscious goals to survive. Create or be created.

Wage slavery is real. It's funny how society is structured in a perfect way to incentivize you to put off your dreams. Jobs are great, but should be a stepping stone. If you can spend 8 hours building someone else's dream, you can spend 1 hour building your own.


> “If you don’t build your dream, someone will hire you to help build theirs.” — Tony Gaskins

This is my perspective. None of these are absolute law. Question what I said, test through experience, and most importantly: Challenge yourself to live a better life. 

## Start Building for Yourself Every Day

You must the unconscious conscious in order to make changes in your daily routines. Your actions contribute to who you are.

You become your choices overtime. And if you are the choices you make, should you not make time to review your daily routine?

1) Take Note Of How You Feel

Pull out a notebook and write down:

- Exactly what you are doing on a daily basis.
- How you feel morning, afternoon, and night.

Take 10 minutes and get specific (Run it with my [Life Reset Prompt](https://selar.com/reset-plan)).

This is important for identifying unconscious parasites (time and energy suckers).

2) Prioritize, Remove, & Restructure

The reason you aren't getting the results you want is because:

- You feel pressed for time
- You don't have energy to get results
- You stopped doing the things that got results

Look over your list from above.

What can you change?

Prioritize the things that will get results.

Remove the things that snuck their way into your day (and don't deserve to be there).

I can think back to a time I wanted to learn new skills to earn a higher income. Netflix, soccer, friday nights outs, parties were off my list.

Restructure specific tasks and obligations to free up more time.

There is enough hours in a day if you prioritize the things you do. The rich and the poor have the same 24hrs in a day.

Get the chaotic structure of your mind on paper and reorganize it.

3) Create A Week Long Plan

You are in this chaotic spot in life because of entropy.

The organization of your life (and therefore the mind) tends toward disorder if you don't perform mental housekeeping.

This is dangerous, because you can pick up bad habits along the way.

Habits are difficult to break.

But you can make the process easier with clarity.

Take 10 minutes.

Write out every single thing you are going to do for the next week.

This shouldn't sound crazy or difficult.

For example on my new study calendar, my waking hour was 4am throughout the week. I had the skills I was learning plastered in my weekly schedule. Not a single day without.

This is how you reduce the friction of making better decisions.

Write out:

- Your morning routine
- Your focused work routine
- Others tasks and meetings
- Nightly routine

You will have to experiment as you go.

If the routine doesn't flow, go back to your notebook and write what you're going to do the next day.

This is how you create a system for your life.

It gets more efficient with time if you make this 'mental housekeeping' a regular practice.

**1. Build Your Mind (Mental Leverage)**  

Read daily. 
Write often. 
Learn something new.  

Your thoughts are your tools — sharpen them.   

Treat your mind like a muscle: feed it information, stretch it with challenges, and strengthen it through reflection. 

A clear mind makes better decisions, and better decisions build better lives.

**2. Build Your Body (Physical Leverage)**  
Move your body daily — lift, walk, or stretch.

> “A heavy body slows a sharp mind.”  
> Your physical state shapes your mental state.  
> If your body is slow, your ideas are too.  
> Fitness isn’t about aesthetics — it’s about energy. Energy fuels creation.

5 habits to design a beautiful life:

1. Build your mind.
2. Build your body.
3. Build your network 
4. Build your business.
5. Build your relationships.

Adopting these 5 habits puts you on the path to having and living a life of fulfillment.

**3. Build Your Business (Financial Leverage)**  
Dedicate 1-2 hours everyday learning how to create and [distribute](https://patrickkyei.com/fullstack-writer) value.  

You don’t need to quit your job. You just need to shift 10% of your time toward ownership.  

Most people think they need to quit their jobs, burn the ships, and grind 12 hours a day to change their lives.

That’s why they never start.

You only need 1–2 hours of focused work.

One hour of writing.
One hour of building.
One hour of connecting.

That’s enough to put you ahead of 99% of people—if you repeat it daily.

The problem isn’t time. The problem is belief. You don’t believe one hour can change anything. You want visible results in days, not months. But time doesn’t bend to your impatience.

Most successful people didn’t just quit their jobs and suddenly work 12-hour days.

They started with 1 hour. They stacked it. They let effort compound.

If one hour is what you have, work with one hour.

Because one hour is enough to change your life.

Write online. Offer a service. Test an idea.  
The goal isn’t to escape work — it’s to _own_ the work that shapes your life.

Work is a necessary part of life. 

**4. Build Your Relationships (Emotional Leverage)**  

Surround yourself with builders, not consumers.  

Relationships are mirrors — they reflect your standards and your future.  

When you have high standards, your mind's survival mechanism notices opportunities that helps you maintain those standards. In this case, you notice more opportunities to get back to having more money in your bank.

Your Google searches start to change to acquire better skills.

You start having conversations about money with your friends.

All of these tiny choices begin to compound into results.

You rewire your thinking patterns based on your intentional search for specific information relating to the problem you are facing.

If you surround yourself with people – physical or digital – that make it seem like it’s “okay” to be 100 pounds overweight, have zero money, work a job you hate, stay with a partner you despise, get drunk every night, and the rest… how do you think your life will end up?

Invest time in people who inspire, challenge, and grow with you.  You can’t become your best self in the wrong environment.



When you build for yourself, something shifts.  You start seeing progress that feels _real._ You start discovering who you truly are and what you’re capable of.

That small window you dedicate to building your own thing becomes the foundation of your independence — the moment you stop waiting for opportunity and start engineering it.

> “Wealth, like happiness, is never pursued directly. It comes as a byproduct of providing value.” — Peter Drucker

Build for yourself consistently — and life begins to bend in your favor.

Because when you take responsibility for your own growth,  you stop being part of someone else’s blueprint and start becoming the architect of your own.

Have a nice weekend.
