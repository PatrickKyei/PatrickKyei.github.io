You are an amalgamation of the ideas, beliefs, and distinctions that you perceive as important based on your programming. If you spend enough time to digest the novel ideas you consume and let them sink in, you'd find they answer most of the questions of your inner dialogue.

I’ve been thinking about how different ideas influence us, whether we’re grinding at work or just trying to make the most of our daily lives.

Today, I will share with you some ideas (quotes) that have influenced my life and that will probably change yours as well.

Don’t miss the last quote.

#### 1. P. **Drucker & A. Lincoln**: “The best way to predict the future is to create it.”

Stop waiting around for things to happen, and start making them happen.

Grab a notebook.

Write out exactly what you want in your future, don't miss a detail. Then, break it down into goals. Decades, years, months, weeks, and days.

Every day, write down the 3 levers you can move to create your vision.

Then, forget about the goals and execute.

Goals are for direction. They are not set in stone. The goals you create today may change in the next 3 months.

Clear structures of what you want allow you to achieve those goals.

#### 2. Marcus Aurelius: “You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”

No matter what craziness is going on around you, the real control is in how you respond.

Filter every thought, emotion, decision, habit, problem, or goal through your vision and drop them without question if they don't align.

Next time you’re facing a tough situation do this:

- Stop.
- Take a deep breath.
- Think about what just happened.
- Ask yourself, “What caused this trigger?”

Whether you’re feeling angry, stressed, or anxious, take a moment to pause, reflect, and analyze what just happened.

"**If it doesn't matter it can control you."** That's the mindset I use to navigate my emotions. I have it in front of my study desk.

#### 3. Benjamin Franklin: “Contentment makes poor men rich; discontent makes rich men poor.”

Patterns I've noticed in unhappy people:

- They care about fitting in
- They lack vision for the future
- They expect too much from others
- They neglect lifelong self-education
- They unknowingly prioritize negative thoughts

They don't realize that happiness is an inside job.

It’s all about finding richness in what you 

Social media makes will make you feel like you are missing out on a lot. People post their smiley selfies and don't show the ugly part.

Pursuing usefulness will make you a lot happier than pursuing happiness

Happiness is the feeling derived from:

- Doing something (making progress)
- Doing nothing (at peace)

Most people are unhappy because they’re stuck in the middle.

They focus on their thoughts instead of reality.

Imagine finding true contentment in where you are and what you’ve got?

That’s a real wealth that money can’t buy.

Aim for that.

Yes, build a business.

Yes, build anything meaningful to you.

But don’t tell yourself that once you’ve built it and started making money from it, you will finally be happy.

Complete happiness is a myth—it’s not real.

What is real, however, is finding joy in everyday moments, regardless of whether your days are good or bad.

Dream big, work hard, but always find joy in what you have.

#### 4. Seth Godin: “Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories you tell.”

When selling anything (courses, services, your ideas, beliefs or products) it’s all about connection.

People don’t just buy stuff.

They buy into stories.

If you’re trying to make a mark with your brand or even just get your ideas out there, think about the story you’re telling.

It’s not just what you sell, it’s the why that really hook people.

#### 5. Winston Churchill: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.”

Winning in life isn’t about getting it right all the time.

It’s about not giving up when you don’t.

I repeat.

It’s not about getting things right all the time but about not giving up when you don’t.

Every setback is just setting the stage for a comeback, as long as you keep pushing.

Be a loser.

Let your parents think you are stupid for not following their path. Start a business and embrace failure after failure. Study the interests that make you feel like an outcast.

Where most people conform is where greatness is born.

#### 6. Robert Kiyosaki: “The richest people in the world look for and build networks; everyone else looks for work.”

Whether you’re working a 9-5 or hustling on your own, the real power comes from the people you connect with.

Building networks, connections, and communities are the stepping stones to success no matter your path.

It's pretty simple.

Whenever I feel like sh*t, it's because I've stopped putting as much effort into the development of health, fitness, relationships, intelligence, or business.

No amount of worrying is going to fix a problem solved by doing.

#### 7. Estée Lauder: “I never dreamed about success, I worked for it.”

Dreaming big is great, but at the end of the day, it’s the action you take that turns those dreams into reality.

If you have goals, don’t just sit on them.

Make a plan, break it down into steps, and start ticking them off.

#### 8. Heraclitus: “Change is the only constant in life.”

Sometimes, you get comfy in your routines, but life is all about change.

If you're lost, start solving problems.

The problems that are staring you straight in the face. Your fitness, health, finances, mindset, work, or anything preventing you from having control over your life.

Experiment until you become obsessed and watch your life change.
#### 9. Maya Angelou: “You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don’t make money your goal. Instead, pursue the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can’t take their eyes off you.”

It’s tempting to chase after the money or the title, but at the end of the day, it’s the passion for what you do that makes the journey worthwhile.

If you love something, dive deep into it.

Master it.

The recognition and success that come from doing something you love are far more satisfying than any paycheck.

#### 10. Farrah Gray: ”Build your own dreams or someone else will hire you to build theirs.”

If you don’t set out to fulfill your own dreams, you will find yourself stuck working hard on someone else’s.

Take charge of your own destiny.

Step up and make your own path.

Don’t spend 99% of your life fitting into someone else’s blueprint.

If you don't choose your own game, society will assign you one, and society's games are incredibly boring. Same quest. Same routine. For 40 years until you win a mediocre prize. You don't want freedom from rules. You want the freedom to create your own.

There is someone putting in half the effort as you and making 10x as much because they took a bet on themselves to stop relying on someone to assign them work with a set dollar amount.

Deciding to build digital leverage is the most important decision you can make

If you don’t know where to start, read the previous letter.

Thanks for reading.
