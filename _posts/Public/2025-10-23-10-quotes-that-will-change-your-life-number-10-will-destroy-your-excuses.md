There are over 5B+ people on the internet in 2025.

It’s never been easier to start a side hustle — or even a full-fledged online business — right from your bedroom.

Or from Port Harcourt.

Or literally anywhere.

We can now work whenever and wherever we want. You can be fully employed and still build multiple income streams on the side before you go full in.

Most people spend time, resources and years of hurdles to "upgrade" their certifications, sharpen their skill set, and become the go-to person at their job yet their bank account doesn’t reflect the upgrade. Usually they get a 3-10% raise most.

Most traditional employment reward positions, not competence.

You’re improving, but your environment isn’t built to scale your value.  
You’re capped by job titles, salary bands, and other people’s approval.

When your skill begins to outgrow your paycheck, it’s time to build an independent source of income — a system where your value compounds without permission.

We are in a permissionless economy. Build an independent source of income.

Building an independent income means using the internet to package your knowledge into something scalable — content, courses, or consulting.

Think of it this way:  
 
Use your 9-5 to fund your 5-9 to build your new business.

Right now, over **4.95 billion people** around the world have internet access.

That means access to _people_ has never been greater. And the **attention economy** is booming.

With the current market conditions, job stability is at an all-time low.  
Building multiple income streams isn’t just smart — it’s survival.

## 4 Side Hustles and How to Get Started

### 1. Career Coaching 

When Sarah lost her job in 2020, she started helping a few friends rewrite their resumes and prep for interviews. Within three months, her advice led five people to new roles — and her inbox flooded with new requests. She turned that into a $3,000/month coaching side hustle within six months. 

This is how the cofounders of Stan started.

If you don’t learn to showcase your skills you'll become a starving artist.

The job market doesn’t care about your degree.

It cares about the value you bring.

If you want to be successful in today's economy, focus on these 3 things:

1. **Identify a high-demand skill**

Web design, digital marketing, coding, or even content creation—find a skill that’s needed in today’s economy.

  

2. **Commit to mastery**

You don’t need to be perfect from the start. Take courses, find resources, learn from mentors and practice daily. Progress beats perfection.

  

3. **Brand yourself**

Don’t hide your skills. Use social media to share your journey, build authority, and attract opportunities. Show the world what you’re capable of.

  
There is always someone who is 1, 2, or 3 steps behind you on the same journey."

You can start with your current expertise — no need to be a guru. You simply help people who are one or two steps behind you in their career journey.
  
Go back several steps (months, years).

Share advice you wish you'd known then.

Show the how. And the now. From your POV.

  
Become a value creator. Not just a self-promoter.

It's the fastest route to authority and trust.

Sell your services for some → But be a leader for many.

  
I learnt coding, design, [writing](https://patrickkyei.com/fullstack-writer) from taking courses and learning from mentors — people with actual results when I had no degree, but I’ve built a career through self education, consistency, practice, and personal branding.

Your story doesn’t have to be different.

Start where you are. Commit to longterm learning. 

And leverage your personal brand to stand out.

**How to start:**

- Identify your niche (career changers, job seekers, professionals in your field).
- Offer 1:1 sessions to test your method.
- Use LinkedIn or X to share tips and build credibility.

**Top 3 Tips:**

1. Find something you’re passionate about and deeply understand.
2. Focus on helping people just a few steps behind you.
3. Start with a service — it gives you quick wins. You can build digital products later.

### 2. Freelancing / Done-For-You Services

In 2022, a Reddit survey showed that 45% of freelancers started earning their first income online with zero prior experience — just by offering services like copywriting, editing, or social media management. Most of them began with one client and built from there.

You can monetize existing skills — design, writing, marketing, coding, or video editing — with almost zero upfront investment.

A business paid me a good amount of money to write for them for just an hour a day.

**How to start:**

- Choose a single skill to offer.
- Create a few portfolio samples.
- Reach out to potential clients via cold email or platforms like Upwork and Fiverr or simply start showing your skills under a personal brand. This is why writing is such an important skill.

Writing is how you:



- Send emails
- Write content
- Write video scripts
- Write advertisements and promotions
- Send networking DMs

- Clarify your ideas to enhance your speaking (in text messages, conversations, videos, and anything else… writing can and should come first).

I am not talking about technical or academic writing.  

I am talking about impactful writing.  

Writing rooted in persuasion, marketing, sales, human nature, and psychology.

You don't need fancy: 

fancy notebooks
fancy courses 
fancy gadgets 

What you need:
 

discipline 
consistency 
commitment

If you are not comfortable on video or don't have the equipments to create videos and pictures for content, learn to write.

### 3. Community Building

When [Ali Abdaal](https://youtube.com/@aliabdaal) launched his “Part-Time YouTuber Academy,” it started as a small community of 200 creators sharing notes. That group has now grown into a thriving six-figure business because people stayed for connection and support.

**Why it’s beginner-friendly:**  
People crave connection. You can build a community around shared interests — productivity, writing, health, or business — even with a small audience.

**How to start:**

- Pick a clear theme and audience.
- Choose a platform (Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, or Circle).
- Host events, challenges, or discussions.

**Tips:**

- Engage daily.
- Lead with authenticity.
- Once the community grows, monetize through memberships or digital products.  
Think of creators like Sahil Bloom or Justin Welsh — they built thriving online communities that became the backbone of their businesses.

### 4. Selling Digital Products

If you want to sustain what you love to do then you'll have to make money.

If you want to make money doing what you love then you will have to start a business.

If you want to start a business you will have to educate yourself with the broader ray of skills necessary to do so. That is a part of your interest-based education.  Starting a business, learning business is a part of your interest base education if you want to do what you want, by your own means, by your own desire, by your own control.

Most people fall into two camps: (1) They work a job that disconnects them from how the product is sold and thus generates revenue, so they do not understand it. (2) They cannot possibly see how “selling” can be a mutually beneficial act, so they virtue signal themselves to death because they want to “focus on their art.”


**Why it’s beginner-friendly:** 

You create once, sell forever. Ebooks, templates, courses, guides — all can generate passive income.

**How to start:**

- Identify what problem you can solve.
- Create a simple product (e.g., Notion template, short guide, or mini-course).
- Use Gumroad or Selar to sell it.

**Tips:**

- Start small and improve over time.
- Build an audience that trusts your recommendations.
- Bundle products or add bonuses to increase perceived value.


## Start Building Multiple Income Streams

With just a few focused hours a day, you can significantly increase your monthly income. Most people will give excuses why can't. I built my brand to 7k while I still had a 9-5.

It’s one of the best ways to stay ahead of inflation, market uncertainty, and corporate layoffs.

A side hustle isn’t just about money — it’s about freedom, optionality, and peace of mind.

So the question is:  
**What will your side hustle be?**

Or maybe you already have one?
