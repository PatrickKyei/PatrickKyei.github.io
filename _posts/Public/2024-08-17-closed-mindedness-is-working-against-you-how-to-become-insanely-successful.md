_When I first started on this newsletter journey, it was out of curiosity._

Schools don’t prioritize curiosity, so most people hate learning by the time they graduate.

Learning is the foundation of the human experience.

Hammer it into your head that you must be learning something, anything, every single day. No matter if it’s for 10 minutes or 3 hours, your future depends on it.

How else are you going to discover new opportunities if you don’t first learn about them? How are you going to act on opportunities that don’t exist to you?

When you stop learning, your life stops progressing. You stop growing. The psychological benefits and feel-good chemicals stop flowing. Life gets mediocre and repetitive. You become mechanical and robotic.

I had started a couple of businesses and failed.

I observed that if I wanted to be successful in business, I needed to know the ins and out of what I was doing.

How do I get people to care and be interested in what I was selling?

How do I communicate to people about how my solution could help make their life easier?

Because one of the problems business solve is convenience. 

You'd rather sit at the comfort of your home, order food you have no idea what went down the preparation process to be delivered to you at your office or home. 

The business has found a way to make the process you would have used to prepare your own meal at home convenient to you. This is why you indulge it all the time.

I let my curiosity pull me down the rabbit hole of YouTube public library to search for information on how I can get a lot of people to be aware of my business solution. 

Nobody knows you.  
  
You have to make people aware of you.  If you have a solution that is so good and nobody knows about it, how is it supposed to bring change? If you have a solution that can potentially make life easy for people so that you can make a living from it and nobody knows about it you will continue to starve. 

I found a wealth of information in the YoutTube library that helped me to create a [facebook group](https://facebook.com/groups/thinkersnperformers) and build an [intimate community](https://nas.io/skillembassy) to supercharge the solution I had built.

### Pay attention to good information.

The world is drowning in information—some good, some bad, and much that’s just noise.
Attention is the new currency. Here's the problem: 

- You scroll past useful information because it doesn’t tickle your humor. 
- You ignore valuable insights because they don’t fit into a 15-second clip. 

What you don’t realize is that the information you’re skipping could be the key to the change you’re looking for.

The first step in transforming your life is simple: Pay attention to good information.

It’s not always entertaining, but it’s the kind of information that makes you think, that challenges you, that forces you to grow.

- **Attention is your currency.** What you focus on shapes your reality. If you spend your time absorbing mindless content, that’s the mindset you’ll cultivate.
- **Curate your feed.** Follow people who inspire you, who make you uncomfortable in a good way, who push you to be better.
- **Don’t confuse entertainment with education.** The posts that tickle your humor might not be the ones that change your life. Don’t let the lure of quick dopamine hits distract you from what truly matters.

### Break out of the shell of comfort 


Society is a behavior system.  
  
The 99% of people that do what they're told question  
nothing and pass down what they know. This leads to a population that can't think for themselves, to a dull, mechanical and mindless life.
  
Your family, teachers and even the people you look up to will tell you to do the same thing that ended them in the same place - nowhere.  
  
Society, all of the societal and cultural information that your parents learned were passed down to them by their parents and then passed down to you and future generations.  
  
The cycle continues if you don't become aware of it and break out of the cycle.
  
Society conditions you to follow the same goal. 
Go to school, 
get good grades,
get a decent job,
retire at 60 when you don't have much time left to enjoy the resources in your retirement.

You are conditioned to depend on everyone but yourself.

The worst place you can be stuck is right before you have to face life. Not painful enough to change, just comfortable enough to stay the same.  
  
A lot of graduates in their parents homes are comfortable waiting on the government to employ them to start their life because they are currently enjoying 3 square meals from their parents, have a place to sleep and probably don't pay for anything. There's a level of "I don't carelism" comfort brings you.  
  
Having to take full responsibility for your life by leaving home prepares your mind to spot opportunities and presents you a different worldview of life.  
  
But I suggest if this is the path you want to take, you plan ahead when you are still in school.  
  
You just have to be intentional about it.
### Create self generated goals 

Everybody told me to go to college, find a job, save enough money and retire at 60.  
  
And so most people have the goal of going to college, getting a job and retiring at 60.  
  
When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is.  
And your life is just to live your life inside the world.  
  
Try not to bash into the walls too much.  
Try to have a nice family life.  
Have fun.  
Save a little of money.  
  
That's a very limited life.  

>"The measure of intelligence is the ability to change." — Albert Einstein 

People are used to the 'linear' approach to things.  
So when attempting something new you have to hit multiple brick walls.  
  
This is the way ideas interact with reality.  
Which is in fact a pretty dense structure of infinite interrelated components.  
  
I always wanted do my own thing. And when I talk about my 'own' thing I mean a personal project - a business.  
  
I was quite early to know that the best way to live a fulfilling life is to work on a project that you can relate and find meaning in.  
  
If you don't work on your own project you will be assigned to work on someone else's project.  
  
I'm just wasting my time at that point.  
  
Why am I going to continue working on a project if it doesn't give me any meaning? 

Business is a personal project and every entrepreneur was trying to solve a personal project whether they had the intention to sell the solution or not.  
  
There's no substitute for doing your own work.  
  
While I was doing my 9-5 I was spending 2-4 hours everyday learning.  
  
If you want to get anywhere in life and you lack the skill, you have to bridge the gap with self education and personal experience.  
  
To get anywhere in life you have to work extremely hard and you have to be disciplined.  
  
If you wanted to be a great piano player there's no drug you can take.  
There's no self-help book.  
  
You got to spend 5 years, 10 years learning it until it becomes something of second nature.  
  
Then you can play chords you could never play before.  
And that's the paradigm for everything meaningful in life.  
  
There are no shortcuts.  

### Mindset is Everything

The thing is that you cannot change your life because you say you want to change your life but you quickly skip the only information that will bring a mind transformation. You jump from platform to platform to chase mindless entertainment to numb your mind.

You become what you consume so consume in accordance of what you want to become.

> "Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything." —Bernard Shaw

Books won’t make you wealthy.  
Courses won’t make you rich.  
Mentors won’t help you.  

We’ve all heard the promises.  Read this book.  Take this course.  Find a mentor.  
Your life will change, they say. I even talk about this too.  

But here’s the harsh reality: If your mindset sucks, none of it matters.  

Your mindset is the lens you filter good information from the noise.

- It determines how you interpret information.  
- It influences the actions you take.  
- It shapes your response to challenges.

You can invest in all the books, courses, and mentors in the world, but if your mind is cluttered with negativity, self-doubt, and fear, those investments are wasted.

The right mindset is open to different worldview, sieve the important one and applies.

**Before you spend another dollar on a self-help book, ask yourself:**

- Are you ready to learn as a student?  
- Can you detach from the need for instant results?  
- Will you commit to the process when motivation fades?

Books, courses, and mentors are tools. But they’re useless without the mental foundation to support them.  

Detach your self ego from your identity.

How do you know if it is your ego or your intuition?

> Your greatest danger here is your ego and how it makes you unconsciously maintain illusions about yourself. These may be comforting in the moment, but in the long run they make you defensive and unable to learn or progress. Robert Greene, The Laws of Human Nature

##### The LOOP

Your ego wants you to stay in a loop; repeating the same cycle over and over again. This is what feels comfortable and safe to the egoic mind since this is all that it knows.

##### The SPIRAL

Your INTUITION calls you to make gradual changes in your life that lead towards ongoing evolution, development, and transcendence. Pure consciousness can see past the repeating cycles of the mind and urges you to move beyond what you think you know.


### The Ego Factory 

> Waking up requires you to become aware of your ego and its resistance to heal


How we interpret what we see is determined by our perspective at the time, and our perspective is influenced by our state of mind.

The ego perpetuates this issue. It doesn’t want to change.

If I am angry and have little experience with business, and I see a post from a billionaire about money… you can guess the outcome.

I will form a concept of who that billionaire is in my mind (after reading _one_ of their posts) and solidify that concept with my beliefs.

“He had rich parents.”

“He got lucky, I could never do that.”

“Why doesn’t he give his money to charity? Doesn’t he have enough?”

Even if you don’t say these things, your ego does.

The ego creates barriers, limitations, and fabricated stories that veil reality. It prevents you from seeing things as they are by filling in the blanks of the static image your ego is attempting to construct.

In reality, you formed your entire opinion of another human being on a post that composes 0.0000000000001% of their contributions in life.

When you adopt a higher perspective, you can start to see things for what they are.

### Build A Business

When the subject of starting a business is discussed, you shy away from it, because you think it is only the successful business people like Dangote, Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey and co that should start one for themselves.

Typical thinking of the ego self.

Worse of all is that, you will even end up calling me a motivational speaker for asking you to start own business.

But listen. 

There is a level of wealth you will never attain in life, if you are not willing to start your own business.

This is absolutely true.

If you want financial freedom start a business.

##### You Cannot Truly Be Free If You Don't Start a Business

Use your weekend to build what would work for you.

Spend your weekends learning to upgrade
yourself, and spend your weekdays working
for your respective employer and you will
never suffer should you lose your job.

You may not have been able to avoid a job altogether, but you could sure as hell get out of it before other life responsibilities start to pile up.

Many people believe financial freedom comes from a stable job but that is an illusion. 

Real freedom is about controlling
when to work
where to work
how much to be paid.

If you can solve a problem in your life, you have what it takes to start your own business.

If you can solve a problem at your job you are qualified to start a business.

It is easy to say, I want to be rich.

It is easy to look at celebrities and influencers, get jealous and secretly wish you were as rich.

But having the actual riches, is a different ball game entirely, compared to wishing for it.

Look at all the true rich people you admire. Look at your boss.

What do they all have in common?

They all run their own businesses.

In fact, the bigger the company, the higher their wealth.

So from Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg, down to Elon Musk, Dangote and Strive Masiyiwa, you don't need to look to far before seeing the businesses they run.

If you want to be rich like the rich, then do what the rich do.

Unfortunately however, what is holding you back from starting your own business, is a lack of the necessary skills needed to run and scale the business.

In basic economics, you must have been taught the four factors of production.


These factors includes

- Land
- Labor
- Capital
- Entrepreneur

If you look at the four factors above, you will notice that the last factor, is called an [entrepreneur.](https://nas.io/skillembassy)

Unfortunately, school trains you to be part of the labor market, rather than to be the entrepreneur.

So you must reeducate yourself into becoming the entrepreneur, if you want to run and succeed in your own business.

To do that, you need a few skills and then you need a big Vision.

Vision is simply the ability to picture how and on what scale the business you're building is going to positively impact your environment.

If your business is not going to positively impact your environment, its better not to start it.

Then you must learn branding, marketing and selling.

These three skills are non negotiable for a person who wants to be an entrepreneur.

The more you are good at these three skills, the more likely it will be for your company to succeed.

Then you must learn product creation, employee management, offer creation.

#### Adopt a new mental module around business

We are not building businesses like we did in the 2000’s.

The first place to build a business in 2024 is online.

> Build distribution, then build whatever you want. – Jack Butcher 

If you will prune away your old mentality and adopt to the modern times, you’d see that starting a business in 2024 is the easiest you can do.

Start as one person. 

Leverage the technology available to you. 

Years ago it wasn’t possible to do this but with the internet powering apps and the technology we use you can build anything if you have distribution. 

Write posts every single day that live on your profile. 

Network with people to get them shared ([so you can grow without the algorithm](https://nas.io/skillembassy/)). 

Start a YouTube channel or Instagram live to build authority 

Plug your newsletter so you own your audience. 

Give away free value to grow your audience. 

Sell a low-ticket product to have more people dedicated to your brand. 

With an audience of 10,000, newsletter of 1,000, and network of 100 – you can do anything you want. 

You have the resources to make a full time income at this point. 

Beyond that, you can funnel extra cash into building your dream company or investing. 

This letter was for big picture understanding. 

Thanks for reading.
