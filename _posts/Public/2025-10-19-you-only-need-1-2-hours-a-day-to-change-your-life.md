Look around.

Everyone is stressed out of their minds.

We all want to achieve big things, but it’s becoming infinitely more difficult to focus on those big things… so none of them ever get done.

Our minds are flooded with:

- The _risk_ of pursuing your own goals instead of the ones your parents, friends, or boss want for you.
- Being told what to care about — skills to learn, causes to support, foods to avoid — by people with goals that don’t align with your own.
- Thoughts about the job you have to show up to, how much time you’re going to waste, and all the things you’ll never get to do.
- The constant anxiety of wondering what people will think if you decide to go your own way.


These are not easy thoughts to deal with.

If your friends or parents don’t support you — or even try to stop you — that can become incredibly painful. You may lose people from your life. You may lose a part of your identity. Which hurts.

**The thing is, they don’t know what you know.**

They haven’t been exposed to the same information, education, and potential that you have. Their minds are programmed with beliefs that served _their_ world — not yours.

Parents are very good at this. They were assigned goals at birth, pursued those goals, saw results, and built their identity around that. But when people stop expanding their minds into adulthood, their beliefs harden. What doesn’t align with what they know stops making sense — and people hate what they don’t understand.

This is the first realization you must make:

**Nobody is going to give you permission to do what you want.**

They don’t see what you see. They don’t have the story you’re telling yourself. And unless they’re developed enough to understand that story, you’ll have to jump out of the nest and trust that you can learn to fly.

But even when you decide to, there’s another problem.

You only have so much focus to invest in your goals each day.  
And most of it gets stolen before you’ve even started.

We can’t focus. We pay too much attention to the goals of others, to the point that we have none left for our own.

As soon as we wake up, we grab our phones and flood our minds with other people’s agendas — news, opinions, advice, doomsday predictions, and people doing better than us.

Our brains crave order. That’s why we feel terrible.

Your attention isn’t anchored to a singular vision powerful enough to silence distractions.  
And when that happens, life starts to feel empty.

You only have one option.

Feel deeply into your situation.  
See where your current habits are taking you.  
Become _fed up_ with your lack of progress.

Use that frustration to laser in on the meaningful goal you’ve been putting off — the one your inner voice won’t shut up about.

-“You were meant for more than this.”
-“You have what it takes to be successful.”
-“You don’t have to end up like the rest.”


Seriously, _feel_ it. Stop avoiding it.

The pain of not achieving your goals must outweigh the pain of living comfortably.  
Only then will your focus become your freedom.

## Create A System For Focus

Once you accept that nobody will hand you permission to pursue your own goals, the next step is reclaiming the one resource you _do_ control — your focus.

Everyone says they’re busy.  That's the anthem of the modern world.
But nobody’s really making any meaningful progress. They still go to the same job that drives them crazy, sit in traffic 4 hours and crush into their couch every night to numb their pain with Netflix and alcohol.

We live in a world where _busyness is a badge_, but focus is a rarity.

People spend hours reacting — to emails, messages, updates, and mindless entertainment. But here’s the truth:  
You don’t have a **time problem.**  
You have an **attention leak.**

Think about it — one focused hour a day equals 365 hours a year. That’s **nine full-time workweeks** invested in your dream — without quitting your job or sacrificing your family. You should pursue your interests but I am not asking you to go and quilt your job without any plan on what to do next especially if you have a family who depends on your income.

People think they need to quit their jobs, burn the ships, and grind 12 hours a day to change their lives. That’s why they never start.  

Most successful people didn't just quit their job and started working 8 hours a day. They started with 1 hour. If 1 hour is what you have, work with 1 hour. Effort compounds.

One pattern I’ve noticed in my life is that I’ve always carved out time to build something of my own. Even when I was working a 9-5.

I will close from work and make sure I get home on time to to spend 1-2 hours on a personal project.

Things like schoolwork, client work, and even projects assigned to me on a job were necessary, but they didn’t bring me the fulfillment I was looking for. 

  
Thanks to deep knowledge being accessible to those who want to find it on the internet, you can become top 10% in any skill with 6-12 months of focused effort.


I realized that the source of most people’s lack of fulfillment is that they’ve never learned or built something that they chose to learn or build.

### The Focus Dividend

Imagine a month where you're unstoppable.

You're reading multiple books, consistently hitting the gym, and shipping your online business like cutting through butter with knife.

You have unbreakable focus when you sit behind your desk to finish a newsletter. You are able to knock out all your high priority tasks.

That’s what I call **The Focus Dividend** — the compounding returns that come from deep, deliberate effort.

In 2019 I applied and got a scholarship to learn high indemand skills with Google. 

When I started I could only commit 1 hour a day to learning. Other non-priority tasks occupied my day but I didn't think much about it to free up those tasks. Things that didn't really contribute to becoming the person I wanted to become. This is the case for most people. They want to change their life, but they want to make the sacrifice that is required to get them the results they want.

When I first committed to just one hour a day, I didn’t see results for weeks. But I kept showing up.

After 30 days, I noticed patterns.  
After 90, my work improved.  
After six months, everything started to click.

That’s the beauty of focused consistency — you don’t need explosive progress. You just need _direction._

Most people burn 8 hours a day doing distracted work.  
The top 1% spend 1–2 hours in a flow state, working on tasks that move the needle towards their future.

They understand something most people don’t:  
Success isn’t about working more.  
It’s about working _deeply._

Deep work builds identity.  
Identity builds mastery.  
And mastery builds leverage.

## The 1-Hour Game Plan

> “The key is not to prioritize your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.” — Stephen Covey

You won’t find time — you must _design it._  
This is where the 1-Hour Rule becomes a game.


**Pick Your Leverage Skill**

You need a goal to work towards. You need a skill to to master that will help you solve the problems life present you. If you don't know what you want, experiment. Stop wondering what to do with your life. Start trying everything until you find the one thing that makes you forget to eat. The thing that makes you lose track of time. The thing that keeps you up at night because the ideas won't stop coming. Give everything for that one thing.

You can an evergreen skill. One skill that compounds: [writing](/fullstack-writer), coding, marketing, or [building a business](/monetization).  
This will be your leverage point.  
Ask yourself:

> “If I could only improve one skill for the next 12 months, what would change everything?”

That’s your answer. Stick to it until mastery compounds.


**Create a Time Sanctuary**

Choose your hour — early morning or late night.  
Those are the hours the world doesn’t demand your energy. Protect them.

No phone. No noise. No distractions.  
Just you, your focus, and your future self waiting on the other side.


**Use the Deep Focus Method**

Break your hour into 3 mini-sprints:

- 20 minutes deep work
- 5 minutes rest
- Repeat three times

This keeps energy high and willpower intact.  
After your session, reward yourself — music, coffee, or go for a 10 minutes walk.  Make focus _feel good._


**Track the Focus Dividend**

Keep a “Focus Log.”  
At the end of each session, write what you worked on and how you felt.  
After 30 days, patterns emerge.  
After 90, momentum builds.  
After a year — you’re unrecognizable.

365 hours of pure focus = 365 steps closer to mastery.


**Build the Focus Identity**

Stop saying, “I’m trying to be productive.”  
Start saying, “I’m someone who protects my hour.”  
Your habits follow your identity.

When you see yourself as a focused person, focus becomes effortless.  That’s when discipline becomes character.


**Expand Once You Have Momentum**

Once your 1-hour ritual feels natural, stretch it.  
1 hour → 90 minutes → 2 hours.

But never chase time at the expense of depth.  
Focus is a muscle — it grows through precision, not punishment.


Most people overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can do in a year.

One focused hour a day may look small, but it’s the foundation of every transformation you admire.  
It’s how skills are mastered, brands are built, and new lives are created.

You don’t need a miracle.  
You just need one hour of truth.

Protect your hour like your life depends on it — because it does.

Every minute of deep work is a vote for the person you’re becoming.

The question isn’t whether you have the time.  
The question is — **will you use it?**

Now I know some of you will ask me what you will do with the free time you get if you empty your schedule.

Build a f*cking project. Anything. A project can be working on your physique, because looks matter – yeah painful truth, build a meaningful relationship, build a brand.

# Why You Should Build A Brand

The internet has created opportunities that most people still don’t see.You no longer need to:

- Apply for 100+ jobs to increase your income.
- Send thousands of cold emails to land clients.
- Spend tens of thousands on paid ads to market your business.
- Waste countless hours looking for A-players for your team or investors for your startup.

All you need to do is build an audience.

Let’s be honest — most people want to make money online. Most people want to make money online but don't how to start. You probably don't the capital to invest in physical assets when you are still trapped in your parents basement.

I recently watched a YouTube podcast with 3 set of entrepreneurs on set. All of them recommended building a brand as the entry to start any a business if they had to start from scratch today.

But very few want to build the audience that makes it possible.

You need people to support your work.

Without them, your ideas, products, and skills remain invisible.

If you’re:

 - A beginner who wants a business that works with any skill
 - A creative tired of waiting for publishers, record labels, or clients
 - A founder who finally sees the power of social media to scale your impact

  Then here’s your wake-up call:

You don’t need luck.

You need an audience.

All you need to do is build an audience.

But most people overcomplicate it.

We take a different approach.

We focus on _writing._ 

Here's where I promote the [Minimalist Writer](https://paystack.com/buy/writing-sprint) sprint. You can skip to the next part if audience building is not something you are interested in right now.

You’ll learn how to:
  
- Turn 1 idea into 7 days of content
- Build your niche of one
- Repurpose your words across platforms
- Attract aligned followers and clients
- Get exponential visibility in my 1M+ Facebook community

No fluff. No overwhelm. Just results.


If you’re tired of posting without growth…

If you want to finally build momentum online…

Join the 5-Day Minimalist Writer Sprint.

Registration is open till Nov 26th.

8PM–10PM GMT+0.

This might be the most important week you’ll invest in your brand.


## Why Writing

Because writing is the foundation of all media.

When you write:

- You test your ideas in public
- You attract people who share your interests
- You build authority without paid ads

1 hour a day of consistent writing can change everything.

Your words become leverage.

Leverage that brings visibility, trust, and income.

Most people wait too long to start.

They tell themselves, “I’ll write when I’m ready.”

But the truth is — writing is what makes you ready.

Writing, in my opinion, is the best way to:

1. Learn new things fast
2. Attract people to your skills and interests
3. Take advantage of the growing internet

If you don't know what to learn, start writing.

Not because writing is a great skill to learn, but because writing teaches you how to think, how to learn, and how to inspire people to care about what you do—and those are the only skills that will save your future.

Writing leads to:

- Attention
- Trust
- Sales

Your words can build a business.

Writing is more than communication.

Writing is how you practice thinking.

Writing is how you document your development.

Writing is how you attract supporters for your work.

## Attention Is The Modern Currency

Most people believe that if they are good at what they do, success will naturally follow.

But that’s not how it works.

You can be the most talented person in your field, but without attention, your skills will go unnoticed. Having a skill is no longer enough.

You need a way to display what you can offer in front of people. You need a personal.

A personal brand is your "digital identity" in the digital space.

A representation of who you are, what you stand for, and how you think.

People are drawn to those they can relate to.

Those who share their values and perspectives.

Capturing attention is much easier
In the past, gaining attention was a laborious process.

You had to physically go out, knock on doors, and pitch your services.

Today, the internet has simplified this process. You can reach a global audience with a single post.

Thanks to information being accessible to those who want to find it on the internet, you can become top 10% in any skill with 6-12 months of focused effort.

If you invest the time it would take to get a degree in building an email list of 50,000 like-minded readers, that’s twice the capacity of what a professional football stadium can hold. Now, if you craft a persuasive message, write a few emails, and promote a product that you’ve created as a solution to your own problems, I would not be surprised if you made the average United States salary in a month, minimum.

Thanks for reading.
