I want to say a big thank you to Shadrack, Ansah, Theophy and the rest of you who sent kind messages on my recovery. I want you to know that I am 90% recovered. I will be fully back in action soon.

Now unto today..

You will probably have to do things throughout your life that others will perceive as “bad,” “shallow,” or “superficial” because they don’t understand the big picture. They can’t see what you see. They criticize you now and praise you later. If you are deciding whether or not you should make a decision, zoom out and attempt to think through all possible scenarios it could create. One day rainfall can cause disaster while it can become the prayer for another group of people. One current can sail the ship, another day it can crush a boat. And even if that decision turns out to be a mistake, welcome to being human, my friend. That’s the only way you can make a better decision the next time. Indecision, stagnation, and not pursuing something greater is the most “bad” decision of them all.

Back to the point.

If you want to be perceived as valuable, you need to generate power.

If your strategy for success is being nice and noble and spiritual, you will be pushed aside by mean people, and they will have more of an impact than you.

The people who virtue signal that power games are bad are playing their own power game. One that is selfish. One that lacks contribution to humanity. One that self-deceives into doing nothing but preaching about how others should change, distracting them from looking in the mirror.

One of the easiest and best ways to make a lot of money is to inherit huge sum from your parents.

Now, if you’re like me who did not have a huge sum to inherit, here’s what you should do…

If you possess a High Value Skill, you will hardly hit rock bottom financially, and even if you do, you'll always get back easier than someone who doesn’t possess a relevant skillset.

In 2019 I was fed up with the progress I was making. I decided to do everything possible to change my situation.

I did construction, I sold in streets, anything legit to raise money.

I worked hard to raise enough money to purchase a laptop even though I didn't have a place to sleep that I could call my own.

So I enrolled in an online course and engrossed myself with learning, night and day. I learned Project Management, Design, Programming, Data Analytics.

I had my first job as a project manager after 6 months of hardwork and commitment. Things started going well. The salary was 5x better than any money I'd ever been paid.

With my added skills in design and programming, I launched my first business with my friend.

Today we are helping a lot of people gain practical skills to land high paying jobs or even start their own businesses.

You don't need fancy:

- fancy notebooks
- fancy courses
- fancy gadgets
    

**What you need:**

- discipline
- consistency
- commitment

There are many skills you can choose from and in less than 6 months, your financial story will change for the better.

- UI/UX
- Copywriting
- Programming
- Cyber Security
- Product design
- Content creation
- Digital Marketing
- Technical Writing
- Cloud Engineering
- Project Management
- Product Management
- Video Editing/transitioning
- Data Analysis & Visualization
    

etc.

Do your research and pick a skill based on what you want to achieve in life and how you wish to contribute to the world.

Learning a high value skill isn't just a nice-to-have—it can change your life.

Become a person of Value and the world will take you seriously.

When I was getting into tech, I took plenty of notes during my learning journey.

Probably just like you did in your college years.

Little did I know that sharing those notes, that knowledge, would be incredibly profitable.

So, when I say, "You're probably wasting your knowledge."

I mean it.

You've spent years of your life acquiring experiences from:

School.  
Work.  
Life.

Here’s the part they didn’t teach you in school and don't want you to figure out in your job:

You can sell your ideas **many** times over.

You can sell it while you sleep.

You spent time, money and energy to gain that knowledge, and therefore it’s worth something to someone.

Stop leaving money and opportunity on the table.

Sharing your knowledge publicly and turning it into products will boost your career, grow your network, and create authority.

There are zero downsides to productizing your knowledge.

## You Cannot Truly Be Free If You Don't Start a Business

Use your weekend to build what would work for you.  
  
Spend your weekends learning to upgrade yourself, and spend your weekdays working  
for your respective employer and you will never suffer should you lose your job.  
  
You may not have been able to avoid a job altogether, but you could sure as hell get out of it before other life responsibilities start to pile up.  
  
Many people believe financial freedom comes from a stable job but that is an illusion.  
  
Real freedom is about controlling

- when to work
- where to work
- how much to be paid.
    

If you can solve a problem in your life, you have what it takes to start your own business.  
  
If you can solve a problem at your job you are qualified to start a business.

# Start A One-Person Business With Zero Experience

The biggest killer is that people don’t believe that business is for them, or that they don’t have enough experience.

First, stop thinking of business as anything more than an exchange of value. A business is a legal structure to build what you want. Our ancestors had businesses, they just didn’t need a legal structure to exchange value. You get something useful, I get something useful. If you want to truly make a dent in a world that revolves around money, drop your noble charity act. _**Acting selfless to feel good about yourself is just another version of selfishness.**_

If you’ve helped your friends or family with any topic that you’ve ever learned about in your life, you have enough experience.

Even more, how do you think you gain experience?

I’ll tell you one thing, you _**don’t**_ gain experience without stepping into the arena. You gain experience by practicing your skills in a real-world setting.

If a freelancer can reach out to clients with zero experience (to _**gain**_ experience) in exchange for money, why can’t you post something valuable online without expecting anything in return?

Make it make sense.

Your imposter syndrome is self-deception.

If it helps, don’t think of your writing as teaching. People will inherently be educated. Instead, think of it as taking notes in public, or sharing the ideas that impacted you the most. People with different goals and personalities find different ideas impactful, so, by just sharing your ideas, you are unique, because your mind is the most unique thing on this planet.

## Your Knowledge is Worth Money

The average student leaves a UK university with **£48,470** of debt (according to The Telegraph) and in the USA it’s **$28,950** (according to Forbes).

That is the cost implication of that learning.

Also, your salary is proof that what you know is worth something.

Otherwise, you wouldn't get paid.

But there’s more to it than that.

_You are unique._

The problems you have solved may not be unique but they are unique to you and you have a unique experience.

That’s the Value.

There are people out there who are trying to solve problems that you have already solved.

Some will pay you to solve it for them.

Some will pay you to teach them how they can solve it faster for themselves.

It really is as simple as that.

Here’s a 4 step process to help you start:

## 1. Understand your knowledge

What do you know best? Think about you:

- **Professional experience:** What specific skills or knowledge have you acquired in your job?
- **Hobbies and passions:** What are you passionate about?
- **Life experiences:** What challenges have you overcome or lessons have you learned?
    

Make a list of all the big things you know and try to categorize them.

Think about how many people might be interested in these topics and how much they might pay to learn about them.

Once you've identified your areas of knowledge, consider how you can package that knowledge into something valuable to others.

Could you create tutorials, guides, courses, eBooks, or coaching?

## 2. Overcome your obstacles

Making time and having the motivation to create content can be challenging for some.

Content is how others will know about you can help them solve their problem so that they can pay you for that Value.

Here are some tips:

- Dedicate specific time blocks for content creation. Even small chunks of time can add up.
- Start small and build confidence gradually. Remember, everyone starts somewhere.
- Define your target audience and what they need to know. This will help you focus your content.
- Believe in your expertise. Your knowledge is valuable, and people want to learn from you.
    

It's one thing to be motivated. It's something else to have systems in place that actually work.

James Clear says:

> “You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.”

This means that it doesn’t really matter what your goal is, you need to work on the systems that support them.

For example: if you want to get up early, put your alarm on the other side of the room.

That’s a _system_ that will make you get out of bed.

You will achieve that _goal_.

You need to do the same when making content.

## 3. Share your knowledge

Don’t overthink this part.

Every piece of content is a ‘product’.

Some of these products are free and some of them are paid.

And it all starts with serving an audience.

This takes time, consistency, and effort.

Here are some strategies:

- **Social media:** Use platforms like X, Facebook, Threads, LinkedIn (_these are the easiest to start with because you don't need technical knowledge like video editing or graphic design_) to share your content and connect with potential customers.
- **Email marketing:** Build an email list and send regular updates to your subscribers.
- **Content promotion:** Share your content on relevant forums and communities.
- **Networking:** Connect with other experts in your field and collaborate on projects.
    

You can take a single tweet and turn it into a product.

You can take a blog post and turn it into 5 tweets.

It’s all up to you how you want to cut the cake.

Remember, consistency is key.

Show up regularly.

Create valuable content and engage with your audience.

## 4. Monetize your knowledge

You’d be amazed at how much money a basic eBook can generate, never mind a full-fledged course or coaching offering. Here are a few ways to make money from your knowledge:

- **Blogging:** Share your knowledge through blog posts and build an audience. You can monetize through Medium, Beehive etc.
- **Online courses:** Create in-depth courses on your area of expertise and sell them online.
- **Coaching or consulting:** Offer one-on-one guidance or advice to clients.
- **eBooks and digital products:** Package your knowledge into downloadable products.
- **Speaking engagements:** Share your expertise at conferences or workshops.
    

It really is as ‘simple’ as that.

You just need to focus.
