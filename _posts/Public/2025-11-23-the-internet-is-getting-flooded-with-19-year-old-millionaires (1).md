Unless you’ve been sleeping under a rock, you will have noticed that the world of work has changed significantly in the last few decades. 

Remote work and artificial intelligence are the two biggest changes. 

There has never been a better time to create a one-person business. 

Here are three assumptions that you may have or have had: 

- You need lots of experience to make money online.  
- You need a huge following on social media.
- You need to have an original idea. 

These are all wrong. 

At a minimum, you just need to be one step ahead of your customer.

The thing is, we’re not in the industrial age anymore, we’re in the Information Age.

>"Knowing what you don't know is more useful than being brilliant." —Charlie Munger

Getting a job and investing your savings isn’t the only option.

For those that have a shred of interest in breaking free of the traditional path laid out in front of you (that you’ve been expected by others to take out of projected fear) — this is for you. 

> Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. —Warren Buffet

That is the first step. If you are not willing or ready to embark on the path of pursuing your life’s work through your innate curiosity, stop reading.

In fact, if you couldn’t tell, people are losing trust in the conventional path’s promises to secure their future. It’s one of the worst options because your time, energy, and emotional well-being are at the control of a boss.

All new wealth is being generated in the digital space.

The idea space.

If you are doing a lot of interesting things in life and not sharing them that's fine. 

But you are missing big opportunities to inspire, connect, partner, earn etc.
## The creator economy.

Boomers of this generation understand where the attention is. And where the attention is, is where the money is – social media.

A place where people aren’t limited by their connections or physical location because they can reach anyone with an internet connection.

And if you have the right skills – [writing](https://patrickkyei.com/fullstack–writer), marketing, and building – all you have to do is get what you build in front of a micro-fraction of people that perceive what you built as valuable.

I would argue that every beginner should build an audience.


Even if you don’t have a product.
Even if you don’t feel ready.
Even if no one knows you (yet).

Why?

building forces you to master the real skills that make any business functional:

- Persuasion
- Writing
- Design
- Psychology
- Human behavior
- Offer creation

These aren’t skills you absorb from books.  
You sharpen them in public — by posting, experimenting, failing, adjusting, and watching what people respond to.

And the upside of becoming a creator today is almost impossible to overstate, but here are the essentials:

1. You naturally develop every skill needed to survive and thrive in a digital business landscape. Courses, tools, and access make the learning curve more straightforward than at any time in history.
2. You accumulate social capital — an audience that becomes your future user base, your early customers, and your unfair advantage. When that time comes, you won’t need personal savings or investors.
3. Your network multiplies. Ten thousand followers isn’t ten thousand people — it’s a doorway into hundreds of thousands through their networks. And no, you don’t need a huge audience to make a living.
4. You attract people who align with your values, your curiosity, and your work. You grow a community that makes your creative journey meaningful and sustainable.
5. You gain leverage. If 30 minutes of writing can grow your audience and lead people to your products, you’re no longer chained to long work hours. You’re powered by output that scales.
    
That’s enough for now.

So how do you actually begin?

Writing.

Why you should start writing online:
- You build credibility
- You attract opportunities
- You become known for your ideas
- Your sharpen you thinking
- You turn strangers into customers

In 2026, the writer wins because attention is currency.

> You can chain me, you can torture me, you can even destroy this body but you will never imprison my mind. —Mahatma Gandhi

As the famous saying, “Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave.”


## Effort Bends Luck. Leverage Bends Time 

The kid building online stores at 3am in front of his computer with 3 Red Bulls and a cup of coffee will be more successful at 18 than the 50 year old man who spent his whole life doing the bare minimum.

> "_The tools for learning are abundant_. It's the desire to learn that's scarce." — Naval

People are losing trust in the "system." 

 - Formal education is overpriced. 
 - People are craving human connection and intimacy. 
 - Everyone is getting tired of centralization in every industry. 

This isn't difficult to notice. 
If you follow me on socials and other similar accounts, you should be well aware of this. 

You can learn more practical information by watching 20 hours of design-related YouTube videos than with a 4 year design degree. 
This goes for any discipline, not just design or industries that you have been exposed to.

You can learn more practical information by watching 20 hours of computer science YouTube videos than with a 4 year computer science degree.

Boomers are making money, becoming millionaires and billionaires in their 18's, 19's and 20's. You and I probably didn't get on quick but you are still early.

What is essentially happening is that the Internet has enabled everyone to become what they want. You don't need anybody's permission. 

What you need is skill. 

You need skills. 

Because those with rare and useful skills:

- survive even in bad economies 
- never stay broke for too long
- can't be replaced by Ai or cheap labor

In the new world, skills = survival.

If you have a smartphone and an Internet connection you have a gold mine in your hands. Start being conscious of how you spend your time. 

## Don't Just Consume. Curate.

Unfollow anyone who does not serve the conditioning of better standards in your life. Even if it doesn’t seem like it, and no matter how much you justify it, the people you follow subtly influence your actions. Slowly, then all at once you become someone you may hate.

Take your time to follow valuable accounts. Valuable accounts challenge your worldview, make you think outside the box, and educate you on the skills necessary to reach a higher quality of life.
 

This is not an overnight process.

You may not find the information useful at first.

It takes time to bridge specific ideas that lead to understanding.

You will probably find it boring… until it’s one of the most interesting things in the world.

Follow one account.

Let the algorithm do its work.

Follow accounts that reply to the first account’s posts.
 

With time, you will create an environment that is conducive to your growth.

The only difference between you and the person more successful than you is the consistent intention behind the information they consume.

*“But what about taking action???”*

You are acting every day.

Why?

Because your mind is programmed with the information conducive to those actions.

Your identity is forged by the information you’ve been fed, and that alone determines what you perceive as an opportunity to act.

Surround yourself with the right people and you can achieve anything you want.

Learn in public. Build in public. 

Thank for reading.
